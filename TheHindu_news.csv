Sangeet Som countered charges of sabotage levelled by Sanjeev Balyan in Uttar Pradesh,"The cold war between two Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders that affected the prospects of the party in key seats of western Uttar Pradesh came out in the open on Tuesday as former party MLA Sangeet Som countered charges of sabotage levelled by former Union Minister Sanjeev Balyan.

Addressing mediapersons in Meerut on Monday, Mr. Balyan had appealed to the party leadership to “take action against those who openly worked for the Samajwadi Party while taking benefits from the BJP”. The two-time MP lost the prestigious Muzaffarnagar seat to SP’s Harendra Malik by 24,672 votes. Mr. Som said that Mr. Balyan “should not have brought up the differences in public, and instead raised his concerns at the party forum”.

The sugar bowl of U.P. emerged as the laboratory of Hindutva for the BJP after communal riots in 2013. Both Mr. Balyan and Mr. Som gained prominence following the polarisation that swept the Saharanpur and Meerut divisions for almost a decade.

However, in the 2022 Assembly poll, when Mr. Som lost the Sardhana seat which comes under Muzaffarnagar Lok Sabha, his supporters held Mr. Balyan responsible for the defeat, accusing him of not delivering the Jat votes. They felt he supported the Jat farmers who participated in the agitation against the farm laws to safeguard his interests. The well-wishers of Suresh Rana, the then sugarcane Minister in the Yogi Adityanath government, also blamed Mr. Balyan for the loss their leader suffered in the Thana Bhawan seat that is part of Kairana Lok Sabha. Mr. Balyan had little choice because he scraped through in the 2019 Lok Sabha against the Jat-Muslim unity mounted by the then Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) chief Ajit Singh.

The infighting diluted the Hindutva glue and the Jat and Rajput identities of party workers surfaced. It became all the more prominent in the run-up to the Lok Sabha poll as Rajput panchayats were held against Mr. Balyan and stones were pelted at his convoy in a Thakur-dominated village, a night before Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed his first election rally in Meerut. Unsigned and undated letters on Mr. Som’s letter pad made it to social media and accused Mr. Balyan of corruption and misuse of power. In Rajput villages, Mr. Balyan faced the ire of Rajput youth for allegedly pushing only Jat candidates in the Agniveer recruitment camps. Mr. Adityanath called for peace as he shared the stage with them, but fissures remained throughout the campaign. Both the leaders continued to take jibes at each other where caste pride was palpable.

On Tuesday, Mr. Som underlined that the party had won from his Sardhana Assembly seat and it is in Charthawal and Budhana segments that it has come second, suggesting that the Thakurs stood by the BJP and it was the Jats who betrayed the party despite it aligning with the RLD. However, Mr. Balyan’s supporters pointed out that the difference in Sardhana was only 45 votes when the party expected it to secure a lot more from Rajput villages that dot the constituency. Local observers feel there is more to it than meets the eye in Mr. Balyan’s presser. Mr. Balyan held consolidation of the Muslim vote and division of the Hindu vote as the big reason for his defeat.

Talking to both camps reveals the possible sources of energy behind the battle between the two powerhouses. While the Jats in the Balyan camp allege that the State government’s attitude to their leader was visible when the district administration cancelled the candidature of three independent Muslim candidates; it ensured there was no division in the Muslim vote, which is around 33% of the total vote. Influential figures in the Muslim community also expressed surprise that there was no Muslim candidate among the 11 candidates in the fray.

The Rajputs, on the other hand, hold Home Minister Amit Shah’s poll speech in Shahpur, wherein he referred to the region as Jatland, responsible for deepening the caste divide that augmented Mr. Balyan’s casteist image. It not only irked the Rajputs but also angered the Most Backward Classes (MBCs) who stood by the BJP in the last two elections.",thehindu
"Get ready for 2026 T.N. Assembly elections, DMK president Stalin tells party cadres","Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and DMK president M.K. Stalin on Wednesday, June 12, 2024, told party cadres to gear up for the 2026 Assembly elections.

“Like the massive victory the DMK-led alliance secured by winning all the 39 Lok Sabha seats in Tamil Nadu and the lone seat in Puducherry during this year’s Lok Sabha elections, let us ensure that we win 200 plus seats in the upcoming 2026 assembly elections. The Mupperum Vizha in Coimbatore on June 15 will give us the required motivation,” he said, in a letter to cadres.

The Mupperum Vizha will felicitate Mr. Stalin for the DMK-led alliance winning all the 40 Parliamentary constituency seats. The event will also be a platform to express gratitude to the public for the victory of the INDIA bloc candidates in the general elections, and will mark the valedictory of the birth centenary celebrations of former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi.

“Post this event, we will be facing the by-poll for the Vikravandi Assembly constituency. We have to ensure our continuous victory there. Next come the local body elections. And above all, we have to start preparing ourselves for the 2026 Assembly elections,” Mr. Stalin said.

“I have also noticed that some people in the opposite camp are asking what was the benefit to Tamil Nadu as there was no chance of [the INDIA bloc] participating in the Union government. That is not a question, but only a lament about their failure”, he said.

Those who believe in democracy and also aware of the rights provided to them by the Indian Constitution, know very well that the 40/40 victory acted as a rein to those in power at the Centre and will provide a safeguard to the Indian constitution, Mr. Stalin said.

In 1957, the DMK had two Lok Sabha members, but got assurances against the Hindi imposition. In 1962, Anna’s maiden speech in the Rajya Sabha, in which he said, ‘I belong to the Dravidian stock,’ was the first speech towards State autonomy. In continuation of this, voices for autonomy are also coming in from BJP-ruled States, Mr. Stalin pointed out. The next set of moves from the INDIA alliance will decide the future direction of India, Mr. Stalin said.

Some parties had been considering the western belt in Tamil Nadu as their bastion. People in that region have made these parties realise where they stand by giving their verdict in favour of the DMK-led alliance. “This is why the Mupperum Vizha is being held in Coimbatore,” he noted.

In the three years of the ‘Dravidian model’ government, people have directly benefited from multiple schemes, and this has resulted in the government earning their trust. “The flagship schemes will continue, and the public’s trust will further be strengthened. You have to ensure that the scheme reaches people and highlight the benefits to them,” Mr. Stalin told the party cadres.",thehindu
"Mohan Charan Majhi, BJP’s vocal tribal leader who attends all village functions","Mohan Charan Majhi, a four-time MLA with roots in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, has been chosen the new Chief Minister of Odisha, marking the end of the BJP’s four-decade-long pursuit of power in the State.

The 52-year-old will be sworn in as the BJP’s first Chief Minister in Odisha on June 12. A member of the Santali tribe, he hails from Raikala village in the mineral-rich Keonjhar district.

As a prominent tribal face of the BJP, he was first elected to the Odisha Legislative Assembly in 2000 and again in 2004. However, he lost his seat in the 2009 and 2014 elections after the BJP-BJD alliance broke down.

After making a modest beginning as the sarpanch of the Raikala panchayat, Mr. Majhi gradually ascended the political ladder. In addition to his political career, he briefly worked as a teacher at Saraswati Sishu Mandir, a school affiliated with the Sangh Parivar.

Mr. Majhi, a law graduate with a Master’s in Arts, returned to the Assembly in 2019. His performance stood out during the five-year term from 2019 to 2024 when the voice of the 23 BJP MLAs was usually overshadowed by the 112 MLAs of the BJD in the Assembly.

Mr. Majhi had introduced seven private member’s Bills, including the Odisha Whistle Blowers’ Protection Bill, 2020; the Odisha Mahila Gram Sabha Bill, 2021; the Reservation of One-third of Employment in Government Posts and Services for Odisha Government School Students Bill, 2021; the Odisha Ground Water (Protection, Conservation, Regulation and Management) Bill, 2023; and Odisha Apartment (Ownership and Management) Bill, 2023.

As the Chief Whip of the BJP in 16th Odisha Legislative Assembly, Mr. Majhi participated in probably the highest number of discussions, be it during adjournment motion or zero hour. Mr. Majhi, who was national secretary of the BJP ST Morcha, always stood up for tribal cause.

His rich experience as the Government Deputy Chief Whip in the 13th Assembly, the Chief Whip of the BJP Legislature Party since 2019 and the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee from 2022 would help him manage government affairs.

A native of Keonjhar, which boasts India’s largest iron ore deposits in one district, Mr. Majhi has been particularly vocal about the irregularities in the mining sector. During the BJD rule, he was at the forefront in flagging corruption in the utilisation of massive funds under the District Mineral Foundation.

According to his confidants, Mr. Majhi hardly misses social functions in every village coming under his Assembly constituency. He personally intervenes to get patients admitted in bigger hospitals. It was his empathy for people that helped him win four terms as MLA in the past 24 years.

On the proudest day of his life, he took time out to console family members of his personal assistant, who died in a road accident on Tuesday. Once the post-mortem got over, Mr. Majhi returned to party MLAs’ meeting.",thehindu
"In Sikkim, NOTA outdid Congress; CM got more votes than 31 BJP candidates","Candidates of the Congress, which ruled Sikkim for more than four years after its merger with India in 1975, polled 50 votes fewer than NOTA (none of the above) in the 12 seats the party contested in the Himalayan State on April 19.

The 31 candidates of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) did better than their Congress counterparts but their total tally of 19,956 votes was 618 fewer than what Chief Minister Prem Singh Tamang garnered for his ruling Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM) in the two seats — Rhenock and Soreng-Chakung — he contested.

The results of the 32-member Sikkim Assembly were declared on Sunday. The SKM won 31 of them while the Sikkim Democratic Front led by former Chief Minister Pawan Kumar Chamling bagged one.

Mr. Tamang polled a total of 20,574 votes and he was the only candidate to score in five digits — 10,480 votes in Soreng-Chakung, his home constituency, and 10,094 in Rhenock.

A five-digit figure is a major achievement in a State with 4.62 lakh voters.

The Congress candidates mustered 1,228 votes across 12 constituencies, working out to 0.32% of the total votes polled. NOTA scored 1,278 in these seats, which was 0.99% of the total votes polled.

In 2019, all the 12 candidates of the BJP forfeited their deposits after managing to get 1.62% of the total votes polled. The Congress fared poorer that year with all its 24 candidates garnering 0.77% of the votes and forfeiting their deposits.

Sikkim has not been a happy hunting ground for the national parties since 1985 when Nar Bahadur Bhandari’s Sikkim Sangram Parishad formed the government after 287 days of President’s Rule.

The BJP hoped to buck the trend, its confidence boosted after 10 SDF legislators donned saffron a few months after the 2019 polls. The party also won two seats in by-elections.

The confidence made the BJP contest 31 seats, but only two of its candidates — State unit president D.R. Thapa in Upper Burtuk and Tseten Tashi Bhutia in Sangha, a virtual constituency reserved for the Buddhist monastic community — were runners-up.

The newly formed and crowdfunded Citizen Action Party (CAP) performed better than the BJP. The regional party totalled 23,267 votes across the 30 seats it contested, which was 3,311 votes more than the BJP managed.",thehindu
Watch: The upsets and gains in Karnataka | Decode Karnataka | Lok Sabha elections 2024,"Following over two months of intense and extensive political action, the 2024 Lok Sabha election is well and truly over. The NDA is back in power and Narendra Modi has taken oath as the Prime Minister of India for a third term.

As the dust settles on one of the most keenly-watched poll season, let us evaluate the electoral outcome in the State.

The BJP, which was decimated in last year’s Assembly elections, won 17 seats. However, it also saw some upsets in the North Karnataka region, where the Congress wrested key seats from the saffron party to increase its tally to 9. Interestingly, the numbers are identical to the outcome in the State in the 2014 elections.

While the Congress government’s five ‘guarantee’ schemes — its major poll plank — could not help it break the single-digit jinx, it does seem to have contributed to increasing the party’s vote share from 31.88% in 2019 to 45.43% in 2024.

What do the numbers say about the unexpected upsets and strategic gains this elections? Did Congress’ guarantee schemes work or was the BJP too overconfident? Between class and caste, which one had a greater impact on people’s votes?

‘Duped’ Sri Lankans fighting in Russia-Ukraine war,"When Sri Lanka's economy crashed in 2022, people sought work abroad wherever they could find it — including ex-soldiers who joined forces fighting in Ukraine after Russia's invasion.

Now the veterans — some of whom swapped their life savings for what they thought would be lucrative, non-combat jobs — are desperate to come back home.

""What we ask is to help bring back our husbands,"" said Renuka Karunaratne, 49, who said her husband was duped into going to Russia by a devious agent.

Colombo's parliament set up an inquiry last month to track at least 2,000 battle-hardened Sri Lankans who reportedly enlisted on both sides of the Ukraine war, including in the regular armed forces and mercenary groups.

With no communication for months, and reports of at least 16 Sri Lankans killed and 37 wounded, distraught families are pleading with politicians for help.

The government says around a dozen Sri Lankans are being held prisoners of war in Ukraine, after being lured there in pursuit of work.

Advertisements shared on WhatsApp groups of retired military personnel promised monthly salaries of more than $2,100, 13 times the average income in Sri Lanka.

Promises were also made of plots of land in Russia, where foreign fighters and their families could settle.

Ms. Karunaratne said she and her husband paid $10,000 to an employment agent to get the job.

""We have sold everything we owned, including jewellery,"" she said while demonstrating outside the Russian embassy in Colombo last week.

""We have mortgaged a part of our house too.""

An unprecedented economic crisis in early 2022 saw Sri Lanka run out of foreign exchange to import food, fuel and other essentials — and ultimately default on its external debt.

Nilmini Chandima Dissanayake, 41, said hardship stemming from the downturn pushed her ex-soldier husband to go to Russia, more than 6,000 kilometres (3,700 miles) away.

""My husband was in the commando regiment for 22 years,"" Ms. Dissanayake told AFP. ""He had retired, he did some odd jobs, but found it was not enough to manage.""

She has not heard from him since May 1, one month after he arrived in Moscow to take up what he thought was a non-combatant role.

""His last call was to plead to get him back home, to save his life,"" she said.

""Every passing day they lose hope of surviving.""

The war in Ukraine has taken a heavy toll on Russian troops, and Moscow has been on a global quest for more forces to fight.

Sri Lanka has maintained a large military relative to its 22-million population since the end of a decades-long civil war against the separatist Tamil Tigers in 2009.

Moscow is believed to have hired thousands of foreign combatants, many of them from South Asia.

Neither Russia nor Ukraine will say how many foreigners are serving in their militaries or how many they are holding as prisoners of war.

In parliament, Sri Lankan deputy defence minister Premitha Tennakoon did not specify how many citizens were fighting on each side of the conflict.

Colombo has remained neutral in the Ukraine war, but reports that Russian authorities supported the recruitment of ex-soldiers from Sri Lanka have sparked tensions.

Police have arrested two retired Sri Lankan generals for illegally acting as recruiting agents for Russian mercenary firms, as well as six people who allegedly helped them with logistics.

State minister for foreign affairs Tharaka Balasuriya said Sri Lanka was pushing Ukraine to release prisoners of war, and would send a delegation to Moscow.

""If Sri Lankans are in a dangerous situation, it's the duty of the government... to ensure that they are safely returned,"" Mr. Balasuriya said.

The Sri Lankan foreign ministry said on June 11 that Moscow agreed not to recruit anymore Sri Lankans to their military.

Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ali Sabry raised the issue with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on the sidelines of the BRICS ministerial meeting in Moscow on June 10, the ministry said.

""It was also agreed that no further recruitment from Sri Lanka will be done,"" the ministry said.

Moscow will accept a delegation from Sri Lanka on June 26 to ""review these issues in detail and take suitable action to arrest the situation"", the ministry statement said.

Russian ambassador Levan S. Dzhagaryan said ""a lot"" of visas had been issued to Sri Lankans, but insisted that they had not told the embassy why they wanted to go to Moscow.

""Why are you talking only about Russia?"" the ambassador challenged reporters last month in Colombo. ""Why don't you talk about Ukraine?""

At least 22 Sri Lankans who joined Russian forces have managed to desert, escape and return home, defence officials said.

Hotel driver Anil Madusanka, 37, is one of them.

""Many people have (economic) problems,"" said Madusanka, now recovering at his home outside Colombo after seven terrifying weeks in Russia. ""That's why they go to Russia or Ukraine.""

He thought he would swap driving tourists for a promised job driving in Russia — but was handed an assault rifle instead and sent to the battlefront to face Ukrainian forces.

He was wounded by shrapnel that tore into both his legs.

From a hospital, he fled to the Sri Lankan embassy in Moscow, which arranged his repatriation last month.

""I am lucky to have escaped,"" he said.",thehindu

Mr. Naidu's son and TDP general secretary Nara Lokesh and Jana Sena Party chief Pawan Kalyan also took the oath of office today.

Mr. Modi also interacted with other Union Ministers and TDP leaders at the swearing-in ceremony that was held at Gannavaram Mandal, Kesarapalli IT Park on the outskirts of Vijayawada. Union Ministers Amit Shah, J.P. Nadda, and Nitin Gadkari were among others who attended the event.

Andhra Pradesh Governor S. Abdul Nazeer, former Telangana Governor Tamilisai Soundarajan were also present at the swearing-in.

This is the fourth time that Mr. Naidu is assuming charge as Andhra Chief Minister and the second time after the bi-furcation in 2014.

Kuwait building fire: Several Indians among 41 killed in apartment fire,"Several Indians were feared to be among 41 people killed on June 12 in a major fire at a building in Kuwait housing workers, according to reports emanating from the Gulf nation.

The fire started in a kitchen in the six-storey building in Mangaf area in Kuwait's southern Ahmadi Governorate in the early hours of Wednesday, officials said.

The building reportedly had nearly 160 people living in it, who are workers of the same company.

Many workers staying there were reportedly Indians.

""In connection with the tragic fire-accident involving Indian workers today, Embassy has put in place an emergency helpline number: +965-65505246. All concerned are requested to connect over this helpline for updates. Embassy remains committed to render all possible assistance,"" the Indian Embassy in Kuwait said in a post on X.

Indians constitute 21% (1 million) of the total population of Kuwait and 30% of its workforce (approximately 9 lakhs).

""Deeply shocked by the news of the fire incident in Kuwait City. There are reportedly over 40 deaths and over 50 have been hospitalised. Our Ambassador has gone to the camp. We are awaiting further information,"" External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said in a post on X.

""Deepest condolences to the families of those who tragically lost their lives. Wish early and full recovery to those who have been injured. Our Embassy will render the fullest assistance to all concerned in this regard,"" he added.

Kuwait's Interior Minister Sheikh Fahad Al-Yousuf Al-Sabah ordered police to apprehend the owner of the Mangaf building where the fatal blaze occurred Wednesday, the building's janitor, as well as the owner of the company responsible for the workers pending the end of the criminal evidence personnel's examination of the scene, the Kuwait Times reported.

""What happened today is a result of the greed of the company and building owners,"" the Minister said in a statement as he visited the fire scene.

He said that he gave orders to Kuwait Municipality and the Public Authority for Manpower to launch immediate action to address similar violations where large numbers of workers are crammed into one residential building, and make sure that all safety requirements are in place in order to prevent similar incidents in the future.",thehindu
Prem Singh Tamang sworn in as Sikkim Chief Minister for second consecutive term,"Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM) supremo Prem Singh Tamang on June 10 took oath as the Chief Minister of the Himalayan state for the second consecutive term.

The 56-year-old politician was administered the oath of office and secrecy by Governor Lakshman Prasad Acharya at a function held in Paljor Stadium in Gangtok.

Eleven other Ministers also took oath along with him.

Thousands of SKM supporters turned up to witness the swearing-in ceremony and cheered for their leader who took oath in Nepali.

The stadium erupted in loud sounds of firecrackers as Mr. Tamang was sworn in. The bursting of firecrackers is otherwise prohibited in Sikkim.

Along with the Chief Minister, 11 other Ministers were sworn in, including Sonam Lama, Arun Kumar Upreti, Samdup Lepcha, Bhim Hang Limboo, Bhoj Raj Rai, G T Dhungel, Puran Kumar Gurung, Pintso Namgyal Lepcha, Nar Bahadur Dahal, Raju Basnet and Tshering Thendup Bhutia.

The council of Ministers in Sikkim can have a maximum strength of 12 including the chief minister.

While three Ministers — Arun Kumar Upreti, Nar Bahadur Dahal and Raju Basnet — took oath in Nepali, eight other Ministers took oath in English.

Only four Ministers of the previous government have been retained this time.

The Chief Minister has rewarded two SKM MLAs Bhoj Raj Rai and Raju Basnet with ministerial berths for defeating SDF supremo and former chief minister Pawan Kumar Chamling in Poklok-Kamrang and Namcheybung assembly constituencies respectively.

Mr. Tamang also included Nar Bahadur Dahal, a first-time MLA from Khamdong-Singtam, in the cabinet for defeating Mani Kumar Sharma, who had revolted against the chief minister in the previous term.

Women, however, failed to get representation in the Tamang cabinet despite four women getting elected on SKM tickets, including the CM’s wife Krishna Kumari Rai.

Chandrababu Naidu sworn in as Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister,"The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) national president N. Chandrababu Naidu was sworn in as Chief Minister of residual Andhra Pradesh for the second time.

Governor S. Abdul Nazeer administered the oath of office to Mr. Naidu on June 12 at Kesarapalle close to Gannavaram near Vijayawada. This is the fourth time that Mr. Naidu will be serving as Chief Minister in his more than four decades of political career. He served as Chief Minister of combined Andhra Pradesh twice, and this is his second term in residual Andhra Pradesh.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, former Vice President M. Venkaiah Naidu, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Medical and Health Minister and the BJP National president JP Nadda, Union Ministers G. Kishan Reddy and Bandi Sanjay, former Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana, matinee idols Rajinikanth and Chiranjeevi, and a host of VVIPs attended the ceremony.

The Jana Sena Party (JSP) Chief Pawan Kalyan, and 24 other MLAs from the TDP, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and the JSP also took oath as Cabinet ministers of Andhra Pradesh. The total strength of the cabinet including Mr. Naidu is 25, as of now.

The TDP, JSP and BJP - partners of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), fought the Assembly elections 2024 against YSRCP. Except for 11 Assembly seats won by the ruling YSR Congress Party (YSRCP), the NDA bagged the remaining seats out of the total 1 75 Assembly constituencies in the State.

While the TDP won from 135 Assembly constituencies, the JSP and the BJP won from 21 and 8 Assembly constituencies respectively. Mr. Naidu allocated three berths to the JSP and one to the BJP going by their numbers in the State Assembly. Mr. Naidu adopted a formula to ensure that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) partners will get their due share in the Cabinet. He selected a minister for each 7 MLAs won by the alliance partner. As the JSP won 21 seats, it got three berths, while the BJP which won from 8 Assembly constituencies got one ministerial berth. The remaining were earmarked to the TDP. The Chief Minister will allocate the portfolios to his cabinet colleagues shortly.

It is widely discussed in political circles that Mr. Kalyan will be made Deputy Chief Minister with a key portfolio. The cine actor turned politician played a key role in stitching an alliance between the TDP and the BJP. Mr. Kalyan continued his efforts to convince the BJP leaders on alliance with the TDP though he received a cold-shouldered response. He, finally, was successful in allying with TDP, JSP and BJP. It helped in a debacle of the YSRCP.

Kolusu Parthasarathy, who switched loyalties from the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) to the TDP just before the elections, was taken into the Cabinet.

Only two former ministers, K. Atchannaidu (TDP AP president) and P. Narayana, in 2014-19 cabinet got a chance in the present cabinet. N. Md Farooq, a senior minority politician who was with the TDP since the formation and had served as a minister with various portfolios earlier, is the lone minority face in the cabinet.

The lone minister from BJP is Satya Kumar Yadav, who won from Dharmavaram Assembly constituency. He is a close aide of former Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu and works as National Secretary of the BJP.

Mr. Naidu did not induct the senior leaders and MLAs such as Gorantla Buchaiah Chowdary and Dhulipala Narendra. Even former ministers like Somireddy Chandramohan Reddy, Nimmakayala Chinna Rajappa, Kaluva Srinivasulu, Kala Venkat Rao, Ayyanna Patrudu and others were not accommodated.",thehindu

Nagaland civic polls: BJP wins two wards unopposed,"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has continued the trend of winning elections unopposed in the northeast.

Two months after winning 10 Assembly seats in Arunachal Pradesh, the party bagged two wards in Nagaland without any contest ahead of the civic polls on June 26.

The elections to three municipal councils (Dimapur, Kohima, and Mokokchung), and 36 town councils are being held for the first time with 33% of the seats reserved for women. The polls are being held after 20 years because of stiff opposition to the women’s quota from traditional tribal bodies.

“BJP has made headway in the Nagaland ULB (urban local body) elections with two of our candidates elected unopposed,” senior BJP leader and the State’s Public Health Engineering Minister Jacob Zhimomi said.

The two victorious candidates are Visheli Zhimo and Kakheka Zhimomi. They won Ward No. 1 and Ward No. 9 under the Niuland Town Council.

State election officials said the two BJP candidates were among 669 candidates who filed their nominations on June 11, the last day of the exercise. They included 61 candidates across the six districts in the eastern part of the State.

These 61 candidates, including 23 women, defied the call of the Eastern Nagaland People’s Organisation (ENPO) to boycott the civic polls because of the Centre and the State government’s failure to create the autonomous Frontier Nagaland Territory. The ENPO had boycotted the election to Nagaland’s lone Lok Sabha seat too.

The ENPO, however, said that its call for boycott “does not seek to subvert individual autonomy” to contest or participate in the upcoming ULB polls.

“Of the total nominations filed, 256 are from the NDPP (Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party), 62 from the BJP, 30 of NCP (Nationalist Congress Party), 24 of NPF (Naga People’s Front), and 21 of NPP (National People’s Party) apart from 201 independents. The rest are candidates of smaller political parties,” a State Election Department official said.

He said the nominations would be scrutinised on June 13 while the last date of withdrawal of candidates is June 18.

The Nagaland Municipal and Town Council Act was passed in 2001 without the provision of reserving 33% of the seats for women, as required under Article 243T of the Constitution. This was amended in 2006.

The first election under the Act was conducted in 2004 without the reservation of seats for women, except in Mokokchung, as it was deemed to infringe upon the special provisions granted to Nagaland under Article 371A of the Constitution.

The decision to hold the elections in 2017 triggered violent protests, claiming two lives, and government properties were damaged across the State.

The tribal NGOs relented after the Nagaland Municipal Act of 2023 did away with the reservation for the chairperson’s post for women, and taxation on immovable property while retaining eight types of taxes, fees, and tolls.",thehindu
President Murmu rejects mercy plea of Red Fort attack case convict,"The mercy petition of Pakistani terrorist Mohammed Arif alias Ashfaq convicted in the nearly 24-year-old Red Fort attack case has been rejected by President Droupadi Murmu, officials said on June 12.

This is the second mercy plea rejected by the President after assuming office on July 25, 2022.

The Supreme Court had dismissed a review petition by Arif on November 3, 2022, affirming the death penalty awarded to him in the case.

However, a death row convict can still knock on the doors of the top court seeking commutation of his sentence on the ground of prolonged delay under Article 32 of the Constitution, feel experts.

The mercy petition from Arif, received on May 15, was turned down on May 27, the officials said, quoting the President's Secretariat order of May 29.

The Supreme Court, while upholding the death sentence, noted that there were no mitigating circumstances in Arif’s favour and emphasised that the attack on the Red Fort posed a direct threat to country’s unity, integrity, and sovereignty.

The attack, which took place on December 22, 2000, saw intruders opening fire at the 7 Rajputana Rifles unit stationed within the Red Fort premises, resulting in the deaths of three Army personnel.

Arif, a Pakistani national and a member of banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), was arrested by Delhi Police four days after the attack.

“Appellant-accused Mohd. Arif alias Ashfaq was a Pakistani national and had entered the Indian territory illegally,” the top court’s order of 2022 said.

Arif was found guilty of conspiring with other militants to carry out the attack, with the trial court sentencing him to death in October 2005. The Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court upheld the decision in subsequent appeals.

The trial court had said that the conspiracy to attack the Red Fort was hatched at the house of two conspirators in Srinagar, where Arif had illegally entered in 1999 along with three other LeT militants.

The three militants — Abu Shaad, Abu Bilal and Abu Haider — who had also entered the monument, were killed in separate encounters.

Despite multiple legal challenges, including review and curative petitions, Arif’s plea for mercy was rejected, highlighting the severity of the crime and the threat it posed to national security.

The Delhi High Court had confirmed the trial court’s decision in September 2007. Arif then approached the Supreme Court challenging the High Court’s verdict. The top court had in August 2011 also sided with the order of awarding the death sentence awarded to him.

Later, his review petition came up before a two-judge bench of the apex court which dismissed it in August 2012. A curative petition was also rejected in January 2014.

Thereafter, Arif had filed a petition submitting that review petitions in matters arising out of award of death sentence be heard by a bench of three judges and in open court.

A constitution bench of the apex court had in its September 2014 judgement concluded that in all cases in which death sentence was awarded by the high court, such matters be listed before a bench of three judges.

Before the September 2014 verdict, the review and curative petitions of death row convicts were not heard in open courts but were decided in chamber proceedings by circulation.

In January 2016, a constitution bench had directed that Arif shall be entitled to seek re-opening of the dismissal of the review petitions for an open court hearing within one month.

The apex court had rejected the review petition in its verdict delivered on November 3, 2022.

This decision comes after President Murmu rejected another mercy petition last year in a separate case, demonstrating a firm stance on cases of heinous crimes.",thehindu
"I planned for A-plus BJP, but got B-minus BJP campaign, says Congress' Gaurav Gogoi","Gaurav Gogoi is clear about the recipe for his landmark victory from Jorhat in Assam in the Lok Sabha elections: he expected an A-plus opposition but encountered a B-minus rival campaign. To top it, he says, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's charisma and campaign had little impact.

Thrown into the deep end of an unfamiliar and newly reorganised constituency with only one month to campaign, nobody had given the young Congress star much chance to win. But he took everyone by surprise — admirers as well as detractors by winning the seat with a margin of 1.44 lakh votes.

His was one of only three victories for the Congress party in the 14 Lok Sabha seats in the State. The Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) won nine.

In an interaction with PTI editors at the news agency's headquarters, Mr. Gaurav Gogoi said people also found the Congress a credible platform to vent their anger against the BJP rule, both at the state and national levels.

“In Assam, I saw a very dispirited and weak campaign by the BJP. I was expecting a much more forceful, meaningful, impactful campaign from the BJP and my planning was for that. I planned for an A-plus BJP but I got a B-minus BJP campaign.”

He said he did not see the impact of Mr. Modi even though the Prime Minister had visited Jorhat twice in the run-up to the election. ""I was extremely surprised that there was not even one talking point which resonated with the people,"" he said.

It was quite different in the previous two elections. In 2014, the people of Assam were talking about the Gujarat model, and in 2019 they were caught up with the [national security] events leading to the elections, he said.

""But in 2024, it was a very localised election. People were looking at local issues, state issues. There was no visible, tangible impact of Prime Minister Modi and his campaign,"" he said.

Besides, there was dissatisfaction among people in his constituency against the BJP dispensation.

""Dissatisfaction is always there. This time people have found in the Congress a credible platform to vent their dissatisfaction. This dissatisfaction is against the BJP dispensation.. in Delhi and in Assam,"" he said.

Mr. Gaurav Gogoi said Jorhat for many reasons was an important election for the BJP, for Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and for his own political plans.

""There are many important reasons for our victory. The Congress gained the trust of the people because the dissatisfaction was always there. Because the factors that went against BJP at the national level in U.P., Rajasthan ... the same factors worked in Assam,"" he said.

Mr. Gaurav Gogoi's previous constituency Koliabor, which he had represented twice since 2014, ceased to exist following the delimitation of constituencies, and Koliabor was renamed Kaziranga.

To make matters worse, he was told by the party’s high command just 30 days before the elections to contest from Jorhat, a Congress bastion-turned-BJP stronghold that has been won twice by the BJP — by a margin of 82,000 votes in 2019 and by a margin of 1 lakh votes in 2014.

This time, however, Gaurav Gogoi triumphed over BJP's incumbent MP Topon Gogoi.

Both the Gogois are from the Ahom community, which make up 32% of the voters in Jorhat. The constituency is made up of 10 Assembly segments, of which the Congress had won only two, one by an opposition Independent and the rest were with BJP — an indication of the uphill battle that Gaurav Gogoi faced. Incidentally, Kaziranga was won by the BJP with a margin of over 2.4 lakh votes.

""I must say it was a difficult election. Out of 14 constituencies in Assam, my constituency was most radically altered — in terms of demography and geography. Every other constituency did undergo change because of the delimitation.

""But it was slightly less significant in terms of geography and demography. Mine went through a radical change. And I did not know from where I would be contesting. While I continued to be the MP from the old constituency, it was splintered and I had no idea where to go,"" he said.

Mr. Gaurav Gogoi, who was deputy leader of the Congress in the outgoing Lok Sabha, said the central election committee of the Congress decided he would contest from Jorhat in mid-March.

Had his father, three-time Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi, been alive, he would have given guidance in the campaign and familiarised him with the grassroots workers of the constituency, Mr. Gaurav Gogoi said.

""I may know the senior leaders, but I don't know the grassroots workers. I don't know the organisation. I used to go for small panchayat level meetings, collecting [phone] numbers during my campaigning. Because I needed to know who were the people who will spread our message in every nook and corner, who are the people who will take forward our publicity material."" That familiarisation period would have been much shorter had his father been there, he said.

""I remembered him, he had the can-do spirit. I think with that spirit, I entered the election and I conducted myself the way he would have conducted -- with lot of aggression but at the same time maintaining the dignity of Assam and politics,"" he said.

Had his father been alive ""we would have a celebratory hug"", Mr. Gaurav Gogoi said.",thehindu
"The social sciences, a shelter for the ‘excluded’ student","The general election is just over and a sizable share of India’s youth is scrambling for college admissions; their contributions are crucial in realising the dream of Viksit Bharat@2047.

The month of May was important for the youth of India as the results of many examinations were released, generating ecstasy, agony, and heartbreaks. The publication of results triggers a rush for seats in higher education institutions, and, in turn, another series of examinations to qualify for these. This transition to higher education is important as it determines the quantity and quality of human capital, which is vital for economic growth. In developing economies, including India, this transition is plagued by a mismatch between demand and supply. The extent of excess seats in some courses and institutions, and shortages in some others, determines the magnitude of exclusion in the system. Persistence of exclusion leads to a scenario of courses in some disciplines emerging as the last resort for higher education for a large section of students, culminating in the creation of a reservoir of the excluded. Recent trends in India reveal that the social sciences are turning out to be one such large reservoir.

Demand-supply mismatches in higher education arise due to the incongruence between aspirations of students and parents, and the availability of courses and seats, which is determined by market forces in private institutions and government policies in public institutions. Perpetual discrepancies in the system lead to three types of exclusions: exclusion due to excessive competition; exclusion due to financial factors, and exclusion based on subjects and courses of study. The first is evident in the case of premier institutions, which have multiple rounds of filtering mechanisms. The fact that these are few and command high social prestige and pole position in the labour market intensifies competition to enter, resulting in focused elimination. The second is common in the case of private institutions as fee fixation is not bound by statutory regulations and is often akin to dynamic pricing in other services. Reduction in government financial grants to public institutions has pushed these institutions to resort to self-financing through higher fees. The third kind of exclusion is due to systemic issues as the availability of courses and institutions gets concentrated in some specific regions, with other regions having generic courses (with outdated topics and syllabus). The prevalence of these three types of exclusions undermines the quality of human capital in the long run.

According to the 2021-22 All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE), the growth of enrolment during the period 2017-18 to 2021-22 for the undergraduate (UG) level is 4.1% and the post graduate level, 5.9%. The Bachelor of Arts (BA) programme, which has the highest enrolment at the UG level, registered an increase of around 15% from 2017-18. There is an increase of 26.5% in the Master of Arts (MA) programmes from 2017-18 to 2021-22. The share of enrolment in the BA programme in total enrolment of BA, BSc and BCom is 51% in regular mode and 75% in distance mode, while the corresponding share for MA is 12% (regular) and 42% (distance). The larger share and a lower transition indicates that BA programmes are turning out to be a generic pool, accommodating a large number of students who are excluded for a variety of reasons.

There are stark differences in preferences for courses within the social sciences. Three things have contributed to this. First, there is a rise in popularity for courses with more empirical orientation as employability for such graduates is perceived to be higher. Courses in economics are preferred more on this ground when compared to courses in anthropology or sociology. Second, there is an overemphasis on acquiring policy intervention skills. The expectation that social science students need to develop problem-solving skills akin to engineering students has grown overtime, resulting in narrower specialisation within the social sciences. Third, there is the emergence of private universities that promise to provide global education in India, which has generated demand from a narrow section of the affluent population. Ironically, courses which are demanded the least in public institutions, such as anthropology, sociology and political science, are in high demand in these private universities, which have emerged as enclaves of higher quality for the affluent.

Higher education in the social sciences — the lens for observing and understanding changes in society, economy and polity — needs an overhaul at all levels. Quantity expansion to accommodate excluded aspirants of other disciplines needs to be followed up with a concerted effort for quality improvement. Teaching quality enhancement and course contents needs to be accorded top priority in such a mission. An obsession with policy and empirical skills has pushed some disciplines and programmes to the periphery. Financial exclusion has resulted in the widening of inequalities and the creation of elite enclaves of education in the social sciences. The aspiration of reaping demographic dividend rests on tapping a vast pool of youth studying the social sciences, which assumes significance in an era of social changes and rapid technological advancements such as generative artificial intelligence.

What is the National Health Claim Exchange? | Explained,"The story so far: The Health Ministry along with the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) are working on measures aimed at allowing patients to access quality healthcare swiftly and with reduced out-of-pocket expenditure. The Ministry and IRDAI are launching the National Health Claim Exchange (NHCX), a digital platform which will bring together insurance companies, healthcare sector service providers and government insurance scheme administrators.

How is the NHCX expected to work?

The NHCX will serve as a gateway for exchanging claims-related information among various stakeholders in the healthcare and health insurance ecosystem. The integration with NHCX is expected to enable seamless interoperability of health claims processing, enhancing efficiency and transparency in the insurance industry, benefiting policyholders and patients, said the Health Ministry.

Asked if the system will help to accommodate the dynamic and diverse healthcare system of India, S. Prakash, MD & CEO designate, Galaxy Health and Allied Insurance Company Limited, said the healthcare landscape has been evolving to align with IRDAI’s objective of achieving ‘Insurance for All by 2047’. “The insurance industry is poised to support the implementation of this system by facilitating streamlined interactions between hospitals and insurers, establishing a seamless, paperless, and secure contractual framework. Acting as a centralised hub for all health claims, the NHCX will significantly alleviate the administrative burden on hospitals, which currently contend with multiple portals for various insurers,” he explained. Twelve insurance companies and one TPA (Third Party Administrator) have completed the NHCX integration.

A timeline has been fixed for insurance claims of cashless claims. The insurance authority has said that all cashless claims have to be processed within three hours of the receipt of discharge authorisation from the hospital. The insurance regulator has set the insurance provider a deadline of July 31 to put systems and processes in place to ensure the smooth facilitation of this latest directive.

While the actual on-ground launch of both the NHCX and time-bound insurance clearance is expected to roll out soon, a senior Health Ministry official confirmed that over 30 insurance companies are already onboard the NHCX platform while effort and awareness drives are going on to bring in the hospitals.

What are some other incentives on offer?

To encourage adoption of digital health transactions and digitisation of patient health records in the country, the National Health Authority had announced financial incentives under the Digital Health Incentive Scheme (DHIS) from January 2023. Under the DHIS, there is a provision that for every insurance claim transaction through NHCX, financial incentives of ₹500 per claim or 10% of the claim amount, whichever is lower, would be given to hospitals, according to a Health Ministry note.

Why is NHCX being brought in?

A paper titled, ‘Health Insurance Coverage in India: Insights for National Health Protection Scheme’, noted that health insurance is an important policy strategy to provide health care services as well as reduce high out-of-pocket expenditure which burden individuals. It points out that for all India, the hospitalisation cases are highest when insured from private purchase (54.4 per 1,00,000 persons). In urban areas, cases for inpatient care are observed to be highest for those covered by government-funded schemes (60.4 cases per 1,00,000 persons). On the contrary, in rural areas, in-patient cases are substantially higher for those purchasing private insurance (73.5 cases per 1,00,000 persons). Also, overall in-patient cases are higher for urban areas compared to rural areas.

Arguing for the NHCX, the Health Ministry states that the platform will help in standardisation and interoperability of health claims and will bring in seamless exchange of data, documents and images between payer (insurance company/TPA/government scheme administrator) and provider (hospital/lab/poly clinic). Additionally, it will enable transparent and efficient claims processing and reduce related operational costs, it said. Industry experts also note that the platform, through uniform data presentation and centralised validation of claims data, could bring in a more standardised approach to healthcare pricing. “This not only improves efficiency but also fosters predictability and transparency in healthcare costs for all parties involved. The transition to digitisation is also anticipated to significantly decrease the cost of processing claims,” say experts.

What are the challenges?

Health insurance contributes to approximately 29% of the total general insurance premium income in India. The primary hurdle in health insurance today lies in improving the relationship between hospitals and insurance companies, said Dr. Prakash, adding that the push towards digitisation requires active involvement from both parties, necessitating upgrades to current IT systems and enhanced workforce training. “Issues such as discharge delays and miscommunication between hospitals and insurers further complicate matters. Building trust among policyholders hinges on delivering efficient services. The NHCX portal aims to streamline the claims process by bringing all stakeholders onto one platform, reducing claim times and standardising procedures. While challenges like data breaches are being effectively tackled, the NHCX stands as an ongoing benefit for all involved, facilitating smoother operations within the healthcare space,” he said.

Parthanil Ghosh, director and chief business officer, HDFC ERGO General Insurance Company Limited, said the benefits from the platform are many. “The NHCX will reduce manual workload and accelerate the entire process, enabling easy tracking leading to better customer satisfaction and also help in fraud detection,’’ Mr. Ghosh said.",thehindu
A push for more climate action,"International climate change litigation reached a milestone on May 21, 2024 when the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) delivered an advisory opinion (the Opinion) sought by the Commission of Small Island States on Climate Change and International Law (COSIS) concerning the specific obligations of the Parties to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) on climate change mitigation. The COSIS is an association of small island states set up in 2021. The ITLOS advisory opinion generates more attention in the context of the advisory proceedings to be decided by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the near future on the “Obligations of States in respect of Climate Change”.

The ITLOS took a radical step by accepting the request of COSIS with the aim of identifying the obligations of states that are not parties to the COSIS Agreement. That is when the request touches principally upon the obligations of states that are not party to the agreement authorising the request. The Tribunal, in its Opinion, laid down very clearly that under Article 194(1) of the UNCLOS, “the Parties have specific obligations to take all necessary measures to prevent, reduce and control marine pollution from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)”.

The Opinion has also removed doubts whether the release of carbon dioxide by man, directly or indirectly, into the marine environment qualifies to be in the category of substance or energy having potential deleterious effects on the marine environment within the meaning of Article 1(1)(4) of the UNCLOS.

The ITLOS clarification on carbon as pollutant bolsters the position taken by the scientific community that the surface ocean absorbs around a quarter of the CO2 emitted into the atmosphere, at increasingly rapid rates, resulting in the progressive acidification of sea water. Other greenhouse gases (GHGs) do not have this effect. In addition, the sea also absorbs over 90% of the excess heat (‘energy’) generated by global warming, resulting in higher ocean temperatures and, ultimately, in sea-level rise.

The principle of prevention or no harm rule which governs state behaviour towards regulation of shared natural resources (between two or more states) so as to avoid transboundary harm of a significant nature in another state has its two main limitations when the rule is sought to be applied to regulate climate crisis: its anchoring in a bilateral frame, and, the principle is not helped due to obstacles relating to attribution and standing in establishing a breach of obligation to climate change.

The Opinion, by siding with the principle for climate change (which is a collective interest as compared to bilateral ones), adds a new chapter. The necessary measures are to be decided in the light of the best available science and the relevant international rules and standards contained in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Paris Climate Change Agreement 2015, and also 1.5° Celsius rather than 2° C as the global average temperature goal.

The Opinion describes the obligation relating to the taking of necessary measures as due diligence obligation but the standard of it in the eyes of the Opinion is stringent one given the high risks of serious and irreversible harm to the marine environment from such emissions. But the Parties’ obligations in terms of taking all necessary measures to reduce anthropogenic GHG emissions within Article 194 (1) are very general in nature. This can be interpreted to mean that neither the release of all pollution (GHGs) must be prevented nor that anthropogenic GHG emissions must cease immediately or even eventually.

Measures that gradually reduce marine pollution by lowering GHG emissions over a period of time would be sufficient. Still, the identification of a general obligation by the ITLOS underlines one thing — that states do not have unfettered discretion in addressing climate change. Mere identification of general obligation will be of symbolic value and is inadequate.

Christina Voigt, an expert on environmental law, says as “most states are already implementing some action on climate change mitigation, the crux of the matter is not the existence of an obligation to mitigate climate change, but rather its content, in particular the standard of conduct applicable in relation to this obligation”. The example to substantiate this point is the decision of the Netherlands Supreme Court, in Urgenda Foundation vs The Netherlands, where the court held that to comply with a general mitigation obligation inferred from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in light of the standard of due care, the Netherlands had to reduce GHG emissions to 25% below 1990 levels by 2020 (as opposed to the government’s insufficient existing pledge of 17%).

The court identified this target largely by relying on scientific estimates and the least cost method of achieving the 2° C temperature goal in the Paris Agreement. The Opinion has not been able to identify the methodology concretely that can be used to assess a state’s requisite level of mitigation action — as in the Urgenda judgment. Moreover, the necessary measures to be taken, as per the Opinion, are to be subject to the means available to the states and their capabilities, which means that the principle of equity cannot be ignored in deciding the requisite level of mitigation action, if any.

Though advisory opinion lacks legal force, it does not necessarily affect its political pull as authoritative judicial pronouncements.

BJP to start process to elect next chief; choice may have RSS imprint,"The formation of the government and distribution of portfolios may have had the imprint of the BJP’s national leadership, but RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s remarks on Monday — on the “undignified” nature of the Lok Sabha campaign, of humility being the ideal characteristic of a sevak or public servant, and his demand that peace be restored in Manipur soon — hint that the election of the next BJP president will be within the close embrace of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.

The induction of current BJP president J.P. Nadda into the Union Cabinet, allied to the fact that his term at the helm of the party was only till the end of June, had already pointed to a change in leadership soon. Mr. Bhagwat’s remarks and the nature of the mandate that the BJP got, 32 seats short of a majority, indicate the likelihood of a churn within the Sangh Parivar with regard to the BJP’s leadership.

At a function to mark the end of a training period for RSS swayamsevaks, Mr. Bhagwat had said, “A true sevak maintains decorum while working... The one who maintains decorum does his work, but remains unattached. There is no arrogance that I did this. Only such a person has the right to be called a sevak,” he said, in an oblique response to the 2024 Lok Sabha mandate being seen as one that calls for greater humility in the BJP that had got a 303-seat majority in 2019.

The remarks that peace must be restored in Manipur was again directed at the Modi government’s inability to control ethnic violence in the State. Both Lok Sabha seats in Manipur changed hands and went to the Congress this time.

There could be many reasons for waters being muddied between the BJP and RSS recently, but Mr. Nadda’s comment that the BJP “runs itself” now compared to previously when the umblical cord between the BJP and RSS was stronger, was seen as encapsulating the main reason. “The BJP is the political wing of the RSS, the RSS is not the silent partner in the equation,” said a senior RSS source.

Many lower level RSS swayamsevaks were disheartened by Mr. Nadda’s remarks, saying that while Mr. Nadda may not have phrased it in a politically correct manner, his “mindset” and that of the current BJP was clear to see. In Maharashtra especially, this alienation between the BJP and the RSS cadre was noticeable, with not many turning up for campaigning, specifically in seats where the Ajit Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) was contesting the polls. “Old resentments against the NCP could not be overcome by this late-hour alliance in Maharashtra,” said a source.

Sources in the party said that a membership drive, the first step to the election process of the new president will be started soon, after which district, state and national level polls will be undertaken. After 50% of State units complete their polls, a national president can be chosen. All of this may stretch to September.

The candidate this time, most agree, will not be one wholly chosen by the current national leadership, but will have to be a considered choice of both the BJP and the RSS. A new president of the BJP will also mean new office-bearers and possibly a new general secretary (organisation), a key post in the party organisation, who is always “lent” to the BJP from the RSS directly. Unwritten rules say that the general secretary (organisation) cannot remain for more than two terms, and B.L. Santhosh, the incumbent has completed two terms.

Sources say that Mr. Nadda may be retained as a working president till the process of electing a new president is complete, or someone else could be appointed to that position, in addition to Mr. Nadda.

The change in the national president will also lead to a change of guard in States. The overhaul there too will be influenced by the mothership of the Sangh Parivar, to ensure that the flock does not stray too far.",thehindu

The controversy surrounding Congress leader Vijay Wadettiwar comments on the death of Maharashtra ATS chief Hemant Karkare refuses to die down. The BJP wrote to the Election Commission of India seeking action against the party and its leader for allegedly peddling lies and defaming Ujjwal Nikam, Mumbai North Central candidate.

Mr. Wadettiwar purportedly called Mr. Nikam an “anti-national” and accused him of hiding the information that terrorist Ajmal Kasab did not kill Maharashtra ATS chief Hemant Karkare during the 26/11 terror attack. Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde said Mr. Wadettiwar’s statement was unfortunate and an insult to those who got martyred while protecting the nation.

On Special Category Status for Andhra Pradesh: Explained,"The story so far: The Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, which bifurcated unified Andhra Pradesh into two States, was notified on March 1, 2014 and had come into force from June 2, 2014. While the Act had specified many things, there was no mention of giving a Special Category Status (SCS) to Andhra Pradesh. Now with the completion of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the demand for SCS to Andhra is again gaining attention.

What is the history?

Shortly after the reorganisation, in a debate in the Rajya Sabha on February 20, 2014, the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had said that “SCS would be extended to the State of Andhra Pradesh for a period of five years”. This was appreciated and seconded by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader M. Venkaiah Naidu.

But after Prime Minister Narendra Modi took over the reigns of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA)-led Union Government, the SCS was put on the back burner. When it was raised in both Houses by the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and opposition MPs, it was said that Andhra Pradesh does not qualify for the SCS, firstly as per norms and secondly due to the dissolution of the Planning Commission in August 2014. The 14th Finance Commission had equated SCS with the general category status and had annulled SCS for new States.

Why does Andhra Pradesh not qualify for the SCS?

The concept of SCS was first brought into existence through the recommendations made by the Fifth Finance Commission in 1969. It was done to benefit a few States through special grants from the Centre. The focus was on States that had socio-economic issues and geographical disadvantages, such as hilly States.

Five factors stood as the qualifying benchmark for the granting of SCS — States that comprise a majority tribal population, low density of population, hilly States and close to international borders, States that have socio-economic and industrial backwardness, and lack of adequate State finances. At present, the States that have the SCS include Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura, and Uttarakhand.

It was debated that Andhra Pradesh, based on the above strictures, does not qualify for the SCS and that the Finance Commission had already annulled it. However, the Centre offered Andhra Pradesh a special package (SP).

What did the special package entail?

Having been convinced that the SCS was ruled out by the Union Government, the first Chief Minister of residual Andhra Pradesh (2014- 2019), Chandrababu Naidu of the TDP, who was then part of the NDA alliance, agreed for the SP. The SP included the recognition of the Polavaram irrigation project as a national project with full funding from the Union Government, tax concessions and special assistance. Though Mr. Naidu accepted the SP, it was termed as a betrayal by the Opposition parties, including the Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP).

In 2018, Mr. Naidu walked out of the alliance and also moved a no-confidence motion which failed. Political analysts say that Mr. Naidu had succumbed to pressure from the opposition, who were building up a strong campaign against the TDP, based on the SCS issue. His volte-face from SCS to SP was being publicised as a ‘betrayal of the State’.

Does Andhra still qualify for SCS?

N.K. Singh, Chairman of the 15th Finance Commission, in his book Portraits of Power, stated that the 14th Finance Commission had never said that SCS cannot be given and that it was up to the Union Government to take a call.

The 14th Finance Commission instead of SCS had increased tax devolution to the State to 42% and also introduced revenue deficit grants for States facing a revenue gap, which Andhra had already received.

SCS, which has an arrangement of funding States in a ratio of 90:10 (90% the Centre and 10% the State), may not be a ruled out chapter for Andhra Pradesh. The Union Government can take a call and refer it to the 16th Finance Commission and the NITI Aayog, and can get back to the arrangement.

Why is SCS in the limelight again?

Ever since the bifurcation of the State, it has been facing a revenue deficit. Additionally, the debts of the State have shot up enormously. Most of its projects and development have come to a standstill and on top of that the building for a new greenfield capital at Amaravati is pending and needs funding.

People are hopeful that since the TDP is again part of the NDA alliance which does not have a clear majority in the Centre, and is dependent on the MPs from Andhra Pradesh, it would be the right time to press for the SCS, for the overall development of the State.",thehindu
Mohan Charan Majhi sworn in as Odisha’s first BJP Chief Minister,"Veteran Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Mohan Charan Majhi was sworn in as the 16th Chief Minister of Odisha on Wednesday.

In the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, their Cabinet colleagues and Chief Ministers of nine BJP-ruled States, Governor Raghubar Das administered the oath of office to Mr. Majhi, a four-time MLA from the Keonjhar Assembly constituency. He is the third tribal Chief Minister after late Hemanand Biswal and Giridhar Gamang since Odisha became a separate State in 1936.

K. V. Singh Deo, six-time MLA from the Patnagarh Assembly constituency, and Prabhati Parida, first-time Nimapara MLA, also took oath of office. The two leaders will serve as Deputy Chief Ministers in the State’s first BJP government.

Sixteen BJP MLAs were sworn in as new Ministers. Of the 16, 11 Ministers, including Mr. Majhi and his two deputies, hold Cabinet ranks, while five were administered oaths as Ministers of State with independent charge.

Mr. Modi arrived at Janata Maidan, the venue of the swearing-in ceremony, from Raj Bhawan with hundreds of people flanking the road. The Prime Minister flew down to Bhubaneswar after attending the swearing-in-ceremony of Chandrababu Naidu, the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh.

Eight MLAs who were handed over Cabinet and independent charges are first-time legislators. Prabhati Parida, Suresh Pujari, Prithiviraj Harichandan, Bibhuti Bhushan Jena and Krushna Chandra Mohapatra have been made Cabinet ministers. Pradeep Balasamanta, Gokula Chandra Mallick and Sampad Kumar Swain will discharge their duties as Ministers with independent charges.

The new government has four Ministers from the tribal community and two from the Scheduled Castes. The remaining 10 Ministers come from the General Category.

Chief Ministers Yogi Adityanath (Uttar Pradesh), Mohan Yadav (Madhya Pradesh), Bhupendrabhai Patel (Gujarat), Himanta Biswa Sarma (Assam), Vishnu Deo Sai (Chhattisgarh), Pushkar Singh Dhami (Uttarakhand), Bhajan Lal Sharma (Rajasthan), Pramod Sawant (Goa) and Manik Saha (Tripura) were present in the ceremony. Union Ministers Dharmendra Pradhan, Nitin Gadkari, Ashwini Vaishnaw and Jual Oram were seen on the stage. Former Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, who was personally invited by Mr. Majhi in the morning, too graced the occasion.",thehindu
"Arrest, agencies, and criminal courts","The Supreme Court did not mince words in May 2024, while delivering two significant judgments that impact the liberty of people accused of criminal offences. The first judgment says that the custody of an accused is not necessary prior to the filing of the charge sheet in certain criminal cases. If the lower courts strictly comply with the directives in this judgment, it would bring relief to investigating agencies.

The second judgment relates to informing an accused of the grounds of arrest in writing. This is a fundamental right under Article 22 of the Constitution. While this judgment was delivered in the context of special statutes — namely, the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967 — it will be relevant to see whether these directives can equally be extended to provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) as far as communication of grounds of arrest is concerned.

In Siddharth v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another (2021), the Supreme Court held that it is unnecessary for the investigating officer (IO) to present the accused in custody at the time of filing the charge sheet if the accused has been cooperating in the investigation and if the investigation can be completed without arresting the accused. The Court held that Section 170 of the CrPC does not impose an obligation on the officer-in-charge of a police station to arrest each and every accused at the time of filing the charge sheet. Therefore, it is not justified under law for criminal courts to refuse to accept the charge sheet without the accused person being produced before them. The Court further said that if the charge sheet is not accepted for any such reason, then attention of the Sessions Judge should be drawn to these facts and a suitable order given.

This implies that in bailable cases and in those non-bailable cases in which the IO thinks that the accused will neither abscond nor disobey summons, the IO is not obliged to produce such an accused in custody while filing the charge sheet in court.

However, the reality is that the IOs sometimes struggle to file charge sheets in criminal courts. In cases of riots, when there are a large number of accused people and every accused person released on bail by the police is not present at the time of filing the charge sheet, the charge sheet is not accepted by the court. Sometimes, courts don’t accept the charge sheet of cases beyond an arbitrarily fixed number in one day, or after a particular time in a day. The IOs are reluctant to complain about these issues to a Sessions Judge because this might prove counter-productive for other miscellaneous works at the ground level. Though the Siddharth v. State of Uttar Pradesh judgment was delivered more than two years ago, the situation does not seem to have changed much.

In Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India and Others (2023), the Supreme Court held that the grounds of arrest must be informed in writing to the accused as a matter of course and without exception, to give true meaning and purpose to the constitutional and statutory mandate of Section 19(1) of the PMLA. Similarly, recently in Prabir Purkayastha v. State (NCT of Delhi), the Court reiterated the ratio of Bansal (supra) case and held that the provision of arrest, as far as informing grounds of arrest is concerned, is pari passu (equal footing) under the UAPA. The Court held that the ‘reasons of arrest’ are purely formal parameters which commonly apply to any person arrested on charge of a crime whereas the ‘grounds of arrest’ would be invariably personal and required to contain details which necessitated the arrest of the accused. Therefore, unless grounds of arrest are informed in writing, arrest and subsequent remand would become invalid in the eyes of law.

Importantly, Section 50(1) of the CrPC also provides that “every police officer or other person arresting any person without warrant shall forthwith communicate to him full particulars of the offence for which he is arrested or other grounds of arrest”. Therefore, even for offences registered under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), an accused is required to be informed about the grounds of arrest, along with important facts of the case. The burden lies on the prosecution to prove that the statutory provisions have been complied with.

The arrest memo prepared by the IO contains a note which says “the arrested person, after being informed of the grounds of arrest and his legal right, was duly taken into custody”. The arrest memo which is written separately for each accused contains inter alia all sections of offence(s) applied, date of offence, place, and time and date of arrest, and is signed by the IO. It is also counter signed by the arrestee. However, there is no provision in law to provide a copy of this memo to the accused person at the time of his arrest. This becomes more relevant for those who are not named in the First Information Report.

The Court has said that the grounds of arrest must be provided in writing so that the accused person can seek legal counsel and seek bail on the basis of unambiguously stated facts of the case by the investigating agency. If that be so, the ratio of the Bansal case (supra) must equally apply to Section 50(1) of the CrPC, particularly when such a right is held to flow from Article 22 of the Constitution. It will be apposite to amend the law and provide a copy of the arrest memo with some modification to fulfil the constitutional mandate towards an accused person.",thehindu
What is happening in the French territory of New Caledonia?,"The story so far: On June 3, the Socialist Kanak National Liberation Front (FLNKS) of the south pacific French territory of New Caledonia called for French President Emmanuel Macron to abandon the plan to modify the electoral reform.

Widespread protests and riots erupted in New Caledonia in response to the French parliament’s decision to amend the voters’ list. The new amendment bill will pave the way for incorporating citizens who were either born or lived in the territory for at least 10 years. Kanaks, the indigenous community of the territory, opposed this on claims that it diluted their electoral power thus marginalising them. The Kanaks comprise 43% of the 1,45,000 population, while the European (French loyalists), Wallisians and Futunians comprise 37%. The new voting amendment will give majority to the loyalists undermining the Kanaks’ future towards decolonisation. This would also mean an alteration of the internal political environment towards French settlers.

What is history of the archipelago?

New Caledonia had Kanaks as the original inhabitants. France gained control of the territory in 1853 and governed the Kanaks with reservations. After the Second World War, colonial laws were abolished and the Kanaks were granted French citizenship. In the 1960s, increased migration from France turned the Kanaks into a minority in New Caledonia. Angered by their deteriorating socio-economic status and lack of economic and political involvement, an independence movement grew along with the emergence of the FLNKS in 1984. Thus, tensions soared between the Kanaks and loyalists between from 1984 to 1988 which ended with the signing of the Matignon agreements in 1988 and the Nouméa Accord in 1998 between the Kanaks and the French government. This allowed the transfer of powers from Paris to local authorities along with three referendums to decide the territory’s independence.

The independence referendums held in 2018 and 2020 were in favour of France, and against an independent New Caledonia. Kanaks requested to postpone the third and final referendum due to COVID-19 in 2021, but the French disregarded the request. A lower turnout ensured a 96% result against an independent state. This infuriated the Kanaks who then opposed talks with the French government.

Why do Kanaks want independence?

Post World War II, after the granting of French citizenship and transforming the French colonies into overseas territories, New Caledonia’s migration pattern increasingly reflected that, of what the Kanaks call, “settler colonialism.”

Under this new model, social inequalities widened leading to the exploitation of the indigenous community. This was observed in the steel and nickel mining sectors, where indigenous people remained as labour while the non-indigenous people reaped economic and political benefits. And despite France’s promise to reverse social inequalities and better Kanaks’ political participation, the 2019 census showcased the poverty rate among Kanaks to be 32.5%, while only nine per cent of non-Kanaks experienced poverty. The scope of economic progress being stalled and the vote by the French Parliament to alter the electoral composition is seen as a move to end Kanak independence.

What is the French endgame?

First, achieving tactical peace. More violence would mean an increased threat to overseas French citizens and a risk to Mr. Macron’s party’s reputation.

Second, integration is key to France’s Indo-Pacific strategy. France considers itself an Indo-Pacific power through its overseas territories which combined makes it the second largest Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Additionally, the large number of French citizens authenticates French governance. The Islands represent a strategic position for France in the Indo-Pacific, especially against China. Therefore, to seal its presence in these territories, integration becomes necessary which is difficult as Kanaks demand independence.

"Tipra Motha Minister Debbarma unhappy with portfolios, to take it up with Amit Shah in Tripura","Tipra Motha leader Animesh Debbarma, who became a Minister in the BJP-led government in Tripura ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, said he was unhappy with the portfolios allotted to him and was looking to take up the issue with Union Home Minister Amit Shah. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Debbarma said he has already raised the issue with Chief Minister Manik Saha.

""I am not happy with the Departments allocated to me. The Forest Department is okay, but Printing & Stationery and Science & Technology excluding TREDA... I am not happy. I met the CM a few days back and urged him to allocate some important departments so that I could help the rural people. There is nothing to hide,"" he said on June 11.

Mr. Debbarma said he would soon visit Delhi to meet Mr. Shah and congratulate him for assuming the charge of the Ministry of Home Affairs again, and take up the issue with him.

""I have been in politics for the last 22 years. Many MLAs get many things even after completing only five years in politics. There is no point if I don't get (important portfolios). I am not against the government but I have to perform,"" he said.

""If one looks at my experience, I was elected MLA many years ago and then worked in the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC) as an executive member, and also performed my duties as leader of the Opposition in the Assembly. I urge the CM to provide important departments to me and I will work efficiently,"" he said.

After Tipra Motha joined the State government in March, Animesh Debbarma, who was the Leader of the Opposition, and Brishaketu Debbarma were made Ministers. Brishaketu Debbarma was made MoS of the Industries & Commerce Department.",thehindu
Going back in time to trace the origin of Broadway Bus Terminus,"The other day I was called up by someone in the government asking about the history of the Broadway Bus Terminus. Surely, the authorities would have some file or the other on such matters, I pondered. But mine not to reason why and so I got down to it. I cannot say I have reconstructed a comprehensive account but there is now a skeleton that should help anyone who wishes to take it further.

Rather ironically, it was the trams that gave birth to the bus service in the city. A strike of its workers in 1925 saw the Madras Tramway Corporation employing 50 buses in the city. Following the resumption of the tram service, the bus service was given up in 1928.

However, private bus operators had seen potential in it and soon began plying routes. By 1946, there were around 200 privately run buses plying in the city. In March 1947, the government introduced 30 buses of its own, marking the beginning of state-owned public transport in the city.

By July 1948, bus transport in the city was fully nationalised. These were run by what was known as the Transport Department housed in the handsome Art Deco-styled Transport House on what was Band Practice Road.

It was only in 1972, following the recommendations of the Justice Somasundaram Committee, that bus service was transferred to a specially formed, state-owned company — the Pallavan Transport Corporation — which, after many twists and turns, is now known as the Chennai Metropolitan Transport Corporation Limited. At inception, it had around a thousand buses running 294 routes, with eleven lakh passengers per day. I wonder what the figures are now. Transport House became Pallavan House and Band Practice Road became Pallavan Salai.

Shelters for waiting passengers were debated upon almost from 1947 onwards, this being considered the responsibility of the Madras Corporation. It was only in 1957 that the first of these was constructed. Broadway seems to have grown meanwhile in an organic fashion as such facilities do in India, with no planning.

Certainly, by 1964, there was talk of the mofussil bus stand, off Esplanade Road and behind the Burmah Shell Building and also the ‘Broadway bus stand’, the latter catering to city buses. Both were bywords for urban chaos. The Corporation repeatedly came up with budgets for improvements but very little seems to have been spent.

In 1969, Mayor Velur D. Narayanan remarked that there were more tea shops and coffee hotels in the area than buses and the stench was “unwholesome”. Incidentally, it was Narayanan who first used the term City Beautiful in connection with Madras and it can be considered the ancestor of Singara Chennai, the present Holy Grail.

Finally, in 1972, the Corporation sanctioned ₹13 lakh for building a proper bus terminus at Broadway and work began. In 1977, the facility was handed over to the Madras Metropolitan Development Authority (now CMDA). By this time, the mofussil bus terminal, which has a parallel history of sorts, had completely taken over the Travancore Maharajah Park opposite the Annamalai Manram on the Esplanade. It was the MMDA that first mooted the shift of the mofussil facility to Koyambedu, a move that took almost three decades to materialise. The Broadway Bus Terminus, catering to the city, in the meanwhile, swallowed the grounds of the Madras United Club in its expansion.

Plans for its modernisation are legion, and the latest is the move to create a multi-modal transport hub there. In the interim, the terminus is to operate from the Island Grounds.",thehindu
"Share Market Highlights 01 April 2024: Sensex gains 363 pts, Nifty closes at 22,462","
• None Stock Market Live Today: Opening Bell: Sensex, Nifty start FY2025 on a high note: Sensex gains over 400 points, Nifty around 22,470 points The first day of the financial year 2025 started with a positive note. The 30-share BSE Sensex climbed 405.60 points to 74,056.95 in early trade. The NSE Nifty gained 144.75 points to 22,471.65. However, analysts expect the market to move in a narrow range ahead of RBI policy, Q4 results, and India Inc.’s FY25 outlook. They feel the general election will likely dampen trading interest in the coming days. FY24 marked a rewarding period for the Indian market. Large caps recorded a substantial 33 per cent return, mid-caps surged by 56 per cent, and small caps excelled with an impressive 63 per cent. “It was loaded by the upgrade in FY24 economy growth, as the Indian GDP forecast was uplifted on a QoQ basis from 6.4 per cent to 7.3 per cent during the year. There was a rampage in corporate earnings growth, like with the 23-24 per cent YoY EPS forecast for the Nifty50 index, said Vinod Nair of Geojit Financial Services. Retail inflows remained robust, supported by direct investments as well as investments through MFs. The number of trading accounts held by domestic investors reached 16.7cr, underscoring increased market participation. Additionally, FIIs exhibited improved net buying activity, buoyed by India’s economic outperformance relative to other EMs experiencing slowdowns, he further said. Pravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst, Swastika Investmart, said: the RBI Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is set to start its 3-day meeting deliberating interest rates and analysing the state of the economy on April 3 and will end on April 5. “Reports suggest that the RBI is likely to keep interest rates unchanged at this meeting. Auto stocks will also be in focus as auto companies will announce the monthly sales numbers for March starting from April 1, 2024. Additionally, people will be watching how the rupee fares against the dollar and keeping tabs on crude oil prices. They’ll also be keeping an eye on investments made by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and domestic institutional investors (DIIs).” Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific stocks are mixed, and most have closed. Japan stocks are down, while Chinese, Singapore, and Taiwan stocks are up in early trade. According to Arvinder Singh Nanda, Senior Vice President of Master Capital Services Ltd, The outlook for the market will be guided by the major global and domestic economic data, India automobile sales, US and India Manufacturing purchasing managers indices (PMI), US job Openings, Factory Orders and US non-farm Payrolls, and Unemployment Rate. “The Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee will meet on April 3-5, 2024, and decide on policy rates. The monetary policy statement will provide important cues on the economy, inflation and interest rates,” he added. Nair said: “ As we move on to a new financial year, we express optimism towards sectors such as Pharma, Capital Goods, and Infra, as we see them as key growth drivers, supported by both domestic and external demand.” He said, “although some sectors like FMCG and IT are facing challenges due to subdued demand at present, we anticipate a turnaround, driven by expectations of a normal monsoon and increased US demand following the Fed’s rate cut. However, the focus is on large caps, as the premium valuation of Midcaps could have a hiccup in the short to medium-term.”

"State of play, Tamil Nadu: Counting on foes who are friends","The ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) swept the Lok Sabha elections in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, bagging all 40 seats. While this verdict and the fact that the power and influence of its arch rival, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is now limited at the national level, gives it reason to celebrate, the DMK is still unhappy about the nationwide outcome.

In fact, the party was never worried about the results in Tamil Nadu. “Let us forget Tamil Nadu. We are more concerned about the national-level verdict,” was the common refrain in the DMK. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, who is also the party president, has been consistently opposing the BJP and its ideology. He knew what would be in store for his government if the BJP was given one more chance to form the government at the Centre.

The DMK was aware that the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), the main opposition party in Tamil Nadu, was a divided house. This increased its prospects substantially. Its allies — Congress, Communist Party of India (Marxist), Communist Party of India, Indian Union Muslim League, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi, and Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam — also garnered votes and contributed to the sweep of the INDIA bloc. During the election campaign, Mr. Stalin said, “Naalai Namathey Narpathum Namethy (Tomorrow is ours and 40 is also ours)”.

The outcome also defied predictions that the AIADMK and the BJP could win a few seats in the State. The DMK may not even have minded if the AIADMK and BJP had won a few seats. Its only concern was that the BJP would get re-elected at the national level with a brute majority, as predicted by the exit polls. Fortunately for the party, its worst fears did not come true.

The INDIA bloc increased its tally across the country, but could not secure enough numbers to put an end to the decade-long rule of Mr. Modi. Their only solace is that the BJP fell short of a majority and is now part of a coalition government. The BJP’s dependence on its allies may tie its hands, thus preventing it from causing trouble to the DMK government.

Today, Tamil Nadu is the only southern State where the BJP does not have a toehold. This has been the case since Mr. Modi was projected as the party’s prime ministerial candidate more than 10 years ago. The DMK won landslide victories in the 2019 and 2024 Lok Sabha elections. In 2014, the AIADMK had secured a massive victory, winning 37 seats in Tamil Nadu, leaving just two seats for the National Democratic Alliance. Even Kerala has elected a member to the Lok Sabha this time.

According to the DMK, the Dravidian ideology has ensured that Tamil Nadu is a fortress against communal forces and has made it impossible for the BJP to permeate the State. The DMK has increased its vote share from the 2021 Assembly polls. But it is aware that lack of unity in the Opposition contributed to its win.

The BJP has come to power in the Centre with the support of the Telugu Desam Party headed by Chandrababu Naidu and the Janata Dal (United) helmed by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. Both these leaders are seen as friends of the DMK. Mr. Stalin called on Mr. Naidu in New Delhi and congratulated him on his victory in Andhra Pradesh. There is a perception that the presence of these two parties in the Union government lowers the risk of the DMK government being targeted.

The DMK had already paid a heavy price to what it calls “vendetta politics” of the BJP. Central agencies such as the Enforcement Directorate have been targeting one DMK leader after another in Tamil Nadu in the last few years. The regional party believes that the BJP, which is now at the mercy of its alliance partners, may not go after its political rivals with the same gusto.

The changed circumstances have given the DMK government the much-needed relief and space it needed to concentrate on administration and implementation of welfare schemes.

The smooth sailing of the DMK will depend not on the attitude of the BJP, but on the attitude of the BJP’s allies. The DMK hopes that they will prevent the BJP from pursuing its own agenda. Even if they remain indifferent, the DMK believes that the increased strength of the INDIA bloc will help it face the BJP.",thehindu
NPP to support Pema Khandu government in Arunachal Pradesh,"The National People's Party (NPP) will extend support to the Pema Khandu government in Arunachal Pradesh, a senior party leader said here on Friday.

NPP Arunachal Pradesh unit president Thangwang Wangham said the party has accepted the people's mandate in the recently held State Assembly elections.

The NPP, led by Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Sangma, which is an ally of the North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), will extend support to the Pema Khandu government, Mr. Wangham said.

""We accept the mandate given by the people,"" he said while assuring his party's commitment to keep the aspirations of the people alive in the State.

Mr. Wangham, who won the Longding-Pumao assembly seat, said the party has a clear vision for the State, region and the country.

""We have regional aspirations with a national outlook and will always work for the welfare of the people and development of the State,"" he said.

The NPP which contested in 20 seats in the April 19 State assembly elections won five seats.

Mr. Wangham outlined the party's focus on development, youth employment, healthcare, education, and combating the drug menace.

He emphasised the goal of creating a drug-free society by raising awareness among addicts about the consequences of narcotics.

""We will work for a drug-free society and will reach the addicts to make them aware of the ill effects of narcotics. Addicts should be given a second chance to lead a normal life,"" he said.

The ruling BJP had won 46 seats in the 60-member assembly, while the NPP bagged 5, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) won three, the People’s Party of Arunachal (PPA) won in two seats, Congress one seat and independent candidates won in three seats.

The BJP also won both the Lok Sabha seats in Arunachal Pradesh, elections for which were held simultaneously with assembly polls in the State on April 19.",thehindu
Union Law Minister Meghwal says Uniform Civil Code is part of the government’s agenda,"Union Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal on June 11 said the implementation of the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) was part of the Narendra Modi government’s agenda.

Assuming charge of office, a portfolio that he held in the earlier government as well, Mr. Meghwal rejected the charge that there was conflict between the executive and the judiciary, and expressed hope that a solution would be found on the issue of the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP).

The MoP refers to the procedure on the appointment, elevation and transfer of High Court and Supreme Court judges, which is yet to be finalised because of differences between the executive and the judiciary.

“I believe that we will certainly find a solution to it,” Mr. Meghwal told reporters after taking charge of the Ministry of Law and Justice.

Responding to a question on the implementation of the UCC, he said that it was part of the government’s agenda.

On the issue of ‘One Nation One Election’, Mr. Meghwal said the committee under former President Ram Nath Kovind had submitted its report, and the Law Commission was also working on the subject.

Mr. Meghwal also signed the national litigation policy document soon after taking charge. The policy document, that is part of the 100-day agenda in the Narendra Modi 3.0 government, will be placed before the Union Cabinet for approval in the coming days.

The Law Minister said a key priority of his Ministry would be faster justice in matters pending in the Supreme Court, High Courts, lower courts, tribunals, and consumer courts.

The national litigation policy has been drafted and redrafted over several years by successive governments, and aims to lay down principles for responsible litigation. A national litigation policy has been a part of the BJP’s manifesto since 2014.

“There is a factor of ease of living in all the stakeholders related to litigation... All stakeholders, including litigants, advocates and others are part of it... the Ministry has finalised the policy document,” Mr. Meghwal said.",thehindu
T20 World Cup: Taking cricket to America involves a difficult culture transfer,"In the 1950 football World Cup, US, a minor power in the game defeated England 1-0. US was characterised as “a team of lower-league dropouts and amateurs.” The win barely registered at home. There was a lone US reporter present and the result was received “with massive indifference,” according to a later writer.

It did not signal a football revival nor was it the starting point of a popular upsurge in the game. To be fair, it wasn’t hyped thus, unlike the T20 World Cup which many see as the game coming home to the country where the first international was played in 1844.

Following the U.S. win over Pakistan, the New York Times headline said, US Scores Historic Cricket Win, but only Pakistan Notices. Once again America seemed oblivious to a sporting feat. A special advisor to the Yankees, the professional baseball team, said the India-Pakistan match reminded him of the Dominican baseball league. It may have been a compliment, but I am no expert on baseball, just as the local reporter who said India beat Pakistan 119-113 is no expert on cricket.

It might be politically incorrect to say this, but America isn’t ready to embrace cricket yet. The picture of a young boy in Michigan or New York putting his oval football away forever and carrying a cricket bat is a difficult one to conjure up.

For starters, the International Cricket Council needs to market the game better, take it to the grassroots with more passion, and explore all avenues including making the commentary and visual presentation more attractive and inclusive.

Right now it seems to have a single-focus policy: India versus Pakistan. Much of the criticism of the drop-in pitches could have been avoided had the ICC paid more attention to the amount of time required to nurse these to international standards.

Low-scoring matches make T20 interesting, but the possibility of injury doesn’t. As former England captain Michael Vaughan said, “Trying to sell the game in the States is great, but for players to have to play on substandard surfaces is unacceptable.”

To attract an American crowd (as opposed to an immigrant one), cricket should be presented in a manner Americans can identify with. It can start with television which is basically for the converted who can put up with the inanities and irrelevancies of the Indian commentators.

Americans need more statistics, more background, more excitement (as opposed to loudness) and better conversation generally. To transfer a culture and a philosophy from an established community to one that is emerging requires a special set of skills.

Just as the ICC must first coach the coaches who can then take the game forward in the US, it must spend time with the TV channels on how best to attract a new audience without losing the old one.

When the American magazine Sports Illustrated sent a baseball writer to England in 1961 to write about this game called cricket, he wrote, “To appreciate cricket, an American must first understand it.” Over six decades later, that is still key.

Decades of American jokes (“Cricket is basically baseball on Valium,” said actor Robin Williams) have to be countered in the public imagination with a suggestion that those who can’t enjoy the game are philistines.

The ICC might have missed a trick in not involving Hollywood and sports stars in a celebrity-obsessed society. Genuine cricket lovers like Mark Wahlberg (“I love the sport, could have played it professionally”) and Gerard Butler, both of whom had stakes in teams in the Caribbean Premier League in the early days, John Hamm, Daniel Radcliffe, Ed Sheeran, Russell Crowe are some examples. Perhaps NBA and NFL stars could have been requisitioned too. Lebron James as brand ambassador? Just a thought…

After scoring the winning goal for the US against England, Haiti-born Joe Gaetjens returned to his country and soon disappeared. He was killed, it is believed, by the death squad of his country’s President. Saurabh Netravalkar, hero of the Super over in US’s defeat of Pakistan, will return to his Oracle office in California when the World Cup stint is done. The difference is significant; not for the first time, sport is writing a chapter in our history.",thehindu
India’s looming financial crisis,"Rapid credit growth is akin to a siren song. It lures economies with the promise of prosperity only to lead them into crises. Each financial boom is framed as a story of financial innovation and good times. But each new story is just whipped-up frenzy, it is, in economist Robert Shiller’s words, “irrational exuberance”. As the economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff explained in their celebrated history of financial folly, governments and market participants dismiss previous crises that followed credit booms by invoking the mantra “this time is different”.

India is in the midst of similar folly, driven by policymakers wedded to an unhinged hype about the country’s performance and prospects. The ‘this-time-is-different’ theme touts India’s digital infrastructure as the catalyst for financial innovation and inclusion, promising growth and equality. Ironically, this lofty narrative has enabled a poorly regulated financial sector and consumers living beyond their means to generate a lending surge.

Both international and domestic analysts are applauding this surge. In December 2023, the Board of Directors of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) praised the performance of the Indian financial sector, citing robust growth in bank lending and low levels of non-performing assets. Similarly, the March 2024 review of National Council of Applied Economic Research cheered a 20% increase in bank lending over the previous year, interpreting the particularly large increase in “personal loans” — while lending to industry struggled — as signalling bright prospects.

This celebration of credit growth deflects attention from the deep-rooted jobs’ and human capital deficit; and it extends the hype into dangerous territory. The truth is that when lending expands, the financial sector looks in good health as new loans pay off old ones. But the house of cards collapses when lending slows and options for more loans to repay earlier obligations get shut. The IMF knows this history well: heavily indebted households and businesses sharply reduce spending to repay their debt, causing an economic crunch.

This distressing script is set to repeat for India especially because of the feverish expansion of households lending at between 25% and 30% a year. As financial intermediaries have pushed their loans, many lower- and middle-income households have viewed the funds as easy cash to make ends meet or to buy homes, gadgets and cars, pay for education, and indulge in ‘lifestyle’ spending, including vacations and elective medical procedures.

A household debt boom is a quintessentially “bad” boom. It does not add to productive capacity but, instead, bids up domestic prices, making the country less competitive. As economists Atif Mian and Amir Sufi report: the higher the household debt burden, the steeper the crash that follows. Add to the bad credit boom a stock market rising unmoored from weak corporate investment and anaemic consumer spending, an overvalued exchange rate, and a tendency for Indian authorities to talk up dodgy data, and India presents a textbook example of the key elements that signal a looming financial crisis. The financial crisis will cause not just economic pain but will also degrade the economy’s long-term well-being.

While the two terms of the Modi government have brought us to this moment, three decades of economic and financial policy are culpable. Unable to generate job-rich manufacturing growth, successive policymakers have pushed the financial services industry to raise headline GDP growth rates: in the last decade, the financial sector has contributed over a quarter of GDP growth.

Making matters worse, Indian-style liberalisation has promoted a large and chaotic financial services industry. At the top are 30-odd large providers — scheduled commercial banks and major non-banking financial institutions (NBFCs), all with a history of rogue behaviour. Alongside, thousands of smaller players, including fly-by-night NBFCs and new fintechs operate in dubious ways.

The problem is simple. There are too many financial services’ providers with too few options to lend for productivity-enhancement projects. Indeed, over time, lending opportunities have narrowed as the Indian corporate sector has reduced its investment-GDP ratio and borrowing pace. Financial institutions have, therefore, been under great pressure to generate profits.

From the start of economic liberalisation in 1991, the search for easy profits spawned scams. But especially after COVID-19, financial services providers redirected lending toward households eager to borrow in lieu of stagnant incomes. The newly emergent fintechs led this charge by offering loans to desperate households at extortionary interest rates. A new set of scammers preyed on the gullible. Yet, some borrowers became addicted to such loans.

Today, a dangerously growing share (approaching a quarter) of household loans is “unsecured,” backed by no collateral. The poster child for unsecured consumer borrowing is credit card debt. In January 2024, Indians owned almost 100 million credit cards, up from 20 million in 2011. While the cards bring convenience, aggressively peddling them to low-creditworthy individuals builds up stress for both borrowers and the financial system. As the Reserve Bank puts it, explosive credit card growth has attracted “below-prime” or riskier borrowers.

Twenty-five-year-old Rohan (not his real name) is an example. He used his card to buy a TV, a laptop, and a smartphone. Drawn by rewards, cashbacks, and “no-interest EMIs” (which bundle interest costs into the purchase price and upfront fees), he quickly fell behind on payments and soon was neck-deep in debt.

Eventually, he took a cheaper loan to pay off his credit card dues. Multiply the Rohans manifold and you have a macroeconomic threat point.

Indian household debt, at 40% of GDP, is low by international standards, but household debt-service-to-income ratio, at 12%, is among the highest in the world because of high interest rates and predominantly short duration loans. Indeed, the Indian household debt-service ratio is alarmingly similar to that in the United States and Spain just before their 2008 financial crises, when high household debt-service burdens precipitated major economic downturns.

The economist Rudi Dornbusch’s warning applies to India: “The crisis takes a much longer time in coming than you think, and then it happens faster than you would have thought.”

The source of the impending crisis lies in a paradox: despite buoyant credit growth, household consumption is increasing at an excruciatingly slow pace. Households are struggling; their savings rates have declined and they are boosting meagre consumption by borrowing money. Soon, it will no longer be possible to repay old loans with new ones and consumption could even contract. The crisis will come initially through such macroeconomic contraction; defaults on loans will follow. The initial defaults will topple more dominoes, a consequence of the interconnected nature of banks, NBFCs, and fintechs. Cascading defaults will induce more economic contraction and financial sector distress.

The 2024 general election results might diffuse the India hype, but a sudden stop in credit could trigger a crisis. Preventing the crisis requires surgically downsizing the financial services industry to better match lending capacity and productive borrowing needs, and weakening the rupee to help expand exports and cushion the downturn when it comes. History makes clear that rapid credit growth and an overvalued exchange rate are a lethal combination.

But policy change is unlikely. In opposition to Joan Robinson’s dictum that finance must follow growth, Indian policymakers have committed themselves to the notion that finance will spur growth and help overcome the country’s severe developmental handicaps in human capital and other public goods. Policymakers are also committed to a strong exchange rate as a metric of the nation’s virility. Meanwhile, as the risks of a financial crisis grow, an acute job shortage persists, reflected most poignantly in a catastrophic regression of the workforce back to agriculture.

India’s heavily credit-reliant economic strategy is akin to a car speeding toward a cliff’s edge without brakes. Sadly, the nation’s financial and policy elite has adopted a see-no-evil attitude. After all, the weak and vulnerable will bear the burden of the crisis, as the dire employment situation becomes worse — and stark inequalities become starker.

Health matters | An entrance test gone sour: NEET,"Every week, someone blows the lid off a key issue in the health care sector, obligingly for our health newsletter. Last week, spilling on to this one, is the NEET 2024 scam. Now, like Murphy’s law, anything that can go wrong, went wrong. For roughly the decade in which NEET has governed entry into medical colleges for undergraduates and post graduates, it has had a chequered progress. While there was strong opposition to the concept of a single test for all, on the basis of social inequities and States’ rights in a federal structure, some States cried off from implementing NEET initially, but all have fallen in line eventually - some complying under duress. Multiple cases were filed in courts across the country, Tamil Nadu passed its own legislation to circumvent NEET. The TN Admission to Undergraduate Degree Medical Courses Bill was passed by the Tamil Nadu Assembly (but not cleared by the Government) that proposed going back to medical admissions on the basis of scores of students in the 12th standard board exams. During its conduct, confusion in conduct of examination, poor management at the centres, charges of highhandedness by examination centre authorities, question paper leak, and using proxies to write the exam have been reported regularly.

Now coming back to NEET 2024: there are multiple aspects to this year’s fiasco: Question papers were reportedly leaked in advance, in some centres, the wrong question papers were distributed; there were technical difficulties; and torn OMR sheets were late/wrong OMR sheets did not allow candidates the full time to complete the paper; after the results were announced, it was noted that an extraordinarily high number of candidates had scored the full marks - 720/720, some had scored ‘impossible marks’ given the assessment protocol; and cheating during the exams using proxies was detected in some centres. The National Testing Agency that conducts the NEET, had to set up a four-member committee to go into the alleged irregularities. The authorities also tried to explain away some charges, stating that the paper was overall easy, so many students had scored full marks, and that the odd marks that were scored were a result of the grace marks granted to about 1500 students from students which had technical issues, as part of a court order. But this did not assuage any one’s ruffled feathers. Least of all, the candidates’.

Students protested across the country: Student outfits protest NEET ‘irregularities’, seek probe. Maitri Porecha spoke to Aspirants who sought NEET re-examination citing flaws in the process. A bunch of students went to court urging that NEET be reconducted in the country: SC seeks NTA’s response for conducting the exam again; refuses to stay the counselling process; In a separate case, Lawyer seeks urgent listing of plea seeking probe in NEET ‘paper leak’ case.

Naturally, the sequence of events also had political ramifications. The Congress party demanded a Supreme Court-monitored probe into ‘irregularities’ in NEET; various State and their ruling governments also pitched, including those who had strong objections to the conduct of NEET itself. T.N. CM Stalin reiterated the State’s opposition to NEET amid alleged irregularities in recent exam, while Kerala’s R. Bindu wrote to the Union Education Minister, and Karnataka’s Chief Minister Siddaramaiah joined others in demanding proper investigation of NEET results. For an overview and some pathways ahead for the government do read our edit on the subject: A NEET mess. The committee is supposed to provide its report this week, and we’ll stay the course on this story, here.

The bird flu story has not flown away yet, it is still around, causing a flutter in some quarters. Last week, the WHO said a Mexico man died of a bird flu strain that hasn’t been confirmed before in a human. This came after nations sounded the alert of the virus crossing the animal-human barrier, slipping into humans, unlike in the past. There has been culling and an increased vigil in areas where there are huge poultry and cattle farms with affected birds/cows. Siddharth Kumar Singh reported that Telangana issued an advisory amid Bird Flu outbreak in neighbouring States and Abdul Latheef Naha wrote about Kerala’s call for vigil against spread of H5N1 virus during Bakrid

There was much rejoicing in gastroenterology clinics and patients last week, as news media reported that a major cause of inflammatory bowel disease had been discovered. Despite increasing prevalence of this autoimmune disease, IBD, which encompasses Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, current treatments do not work in every patient and attempts to develop new drugs often fail due to our incomplete understanding of what causes IBD.Researchers at Francis Crick Institute, in collaboration with UCL and Imperial College London published their findings in Nature. Scientists at the Crick journeyed into a ‘gene desert’ - an area of DNA that doesn’t code for proteins - which has previously been linked to IBD and several other autoimmune diseases. They found that this gene desert contains an ‘enhancer’, a section of DNA that is like a volume dial for nearby genes, able to crank up the amount of proteins they make. The team discovered that this particular enhancer was only active in macrophages, a type of immune cell known to be important in IBD, and boosted a gene called ETS2, with higher levels correlating with a higher risk of disease. Further, using genetic editing, the scientists showed that ETS2 was essential for almost all inflammatory functions in macrophages, including several that directly contribute to tissue damage in IBD. Strikingly, simply increasing the amount of ETS2 in resting macrophages turned them into inflammatory cells that closely resembled those from IBD patients.

Afshan Yasmeen brings to focus a key aspect of student life, the mental health of students. NIMHANS, State Health and Education Departments will start deliberations on an ICMR project to focus on student mental health. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has initiated a multi-state implementation research study on student mental health that is being conducted in eight states and union territories, aimed at developing resources within educational campuses to establish an evidence-informed, feasible, scalable and sustainable implementation model for mental wellbeing promotion and suicide risk reduction among students in schools from 9th and 10th standards, pre-university and colleges.

In other important news, Health Ministry reworks its protocol as India’s Tuberculosis elimination drive hits a plateau, what with the 2025 elimination target looming large. Despite nearly 5 decades in battling with TB, India’s gains are quite meagre. TB kills an estimated 480,000 Indians every year or over 1,400 patients every day. Additionally, the country also has more than a million ‘missing’ TB cases annually, which are not notified. Most remain either undiagnosed, or unaccountably and inadequately diagnosed and treated in the private sector. Acknowledging that the drive is flailing, the Health Ministry has launched into action. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has been tasked to rework the protocol, specifically TB medication and its duration, to reboot the TB-free initiative with zero deaths, disease, and poverty resulting from the disease.

If survival of the fittest is at the heart of evolution, then why does altruism exist in nature, asks D. P. Kasbekar in our tail piece for the week. ‘Green-beard’ genes could explain how altruism arose in nature Altruism is widespread in nature, he points out. Worker honey bees devote their entire life to foraging and caring for their sister, the queen, and her offspring, but do not themselves reproduce. In widow spiders, a male allows a female fertilised by him to eat him, and thus nourish herself and her offspring. How can the emergence of altruism in all these diverse forms be explained? Most of the progress in answering this question has come from studies of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. The take-home message is that if a gene makes a worker bee altruistic, it also helps the copy of the gene in the queen and her offspring to be passed on to the next generation, even if the worker herself does not reproduce. Such so-called ‘green-beard’ genes allow the individuals bearing them to recognise and preferentially cooperate with each other. Alternatively, a green-beard gene could provoke individuals to behave harmfully towards those carrying a different version of the gene. Thus, scientists have postulated, green-beard genes encode some kind of tag that helps the genome to know their identity (i.e. self-recognition).

Here are some of the top explainers this week on health issues:

This is a story you might want to read this week. Bindu Shajan Perappadan throws light on the National Health Claim Exchange.

Modi Cabinet 2024: Shivraj Singh Chouhan takes charge of Agriculture Ministry; farmers welfare top priority,"Senior BJP leader Shivraj Singh Chouhan took charge of the Union Agriculture Ministry and Rural Development. He had held an informal meeting with the top bureaucrats of the two Ministries on Monday evening.

Mr. Chouhan has his work cut out with the farmers’ organisations threatening to launch fresh protests demanding legal guarantee for minimum support price for all crops. A group of farmers, who were stopped from entering Delhi, has been camping at Khanauri near the Punjab-Haryana boundary for several weeks demanding the same. The last five years of the Narendra Modi government were marked by relentless protest, which led to their oldest allies the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) snapping ties with the BJP.

Speaking to the media persons, the former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh underlined that Prime Minister Narendra Modi began his day in office by authorising the release of the 17th instalment of PM Kisan Nidhi, which will benefit 9.3 crore farmers and distribute around ₹20,000 crore.

“The Prime Minister has resolved to double the income of farmers, work is going on continuously for that. We will all work together even faster on that and take every possible step for the welfare of farmers,” the Union Minister said. He also handed over BJP’s “Sankalp Patra” – a document detailing the party’s promises and guarantees to the top bureaucrats of the agriculture ministry.

Later in the day, he also took charge of the Rural Development Ministry. Speaking to mediapersons at the Ministry, he said, in the last 10-year the BJP government has taken many “revolutionary steps” in the rural sector. In MGNREGS, he said more emphasis will be laid down on “asset creation”.

The 65-year-old leader took oath as part of the Prime Minister’s Council of Ministers on Sunday, marking a significant milestone in his over three-decade-long political career.

The BJP leader won the Vidisha Lok Sabha seat for an impressive sixth time, securing a record margin of 8.21 lakh votes. Born on March 5, 1959, in a farming family in Jait village, Sehore district, Mr. Chouhan’s political journey began with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) when he was 13 years old. He was first elected to the Madhya Pradesh Assembly from Budhni constituency in 1990 and later became a Member of Parliament from Vidisha in 1991. He was re-elected from the same constituency in 1996, 1998, 1999, and 2004, winning his fifth Lok Sabha election with an impressive margin of over 2,60,000 votes.",thehindu
Nepal seeks help from India to set up Jan Aushadhi Kendra,"After Mauritius, now Nepal has approached India to set up Jan Aushadhi Kendras in that country, which would allow its citizens to benefit from low cost ‘Made in India’ generic medicines.

Earlier, Mauritius became the first country to adopt the ‘Jan Aushadhi Scheme’, enabling it to source about 250 high quality medicines from the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Bureau of India.

“Mauritius has now asked India to provide it verification for 33 drugs that form part of the Jan Aushadhi drug package. Additionally, Nepal has also shown interest in getting the facility,’’ a senior Health Ministry official said.

The Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) is a flagship Central government scheme under which quality generic medicines are made available at affordable prices via dedicated outlets called Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Janaushadhi Kendras (PMBJK). India currently has over 10,000 PMBJKs across the country.

The scheme is being implemented by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Bureau of India, an autonomous society under the Department of Pharmaceuticals.

A press release by the Central government said the scheme, “aims to make available quality medicines and surgical items at affordable prices for all and thereby reduce out-of-pocket expenditure of consumers/patients and popularise generic medicines among the masses”.

“Product basket of PMBJP comprises 1965 medicines and 293 surgical equipment covering all major therapeutic groups such as anti-infectives, anti-diabetics, cardiovasculars, anti-cancers, gastro-intestinal medicines, etc., which are available for sale through these kendras,” the press release also stated. In 2023, 206 medicines and 13 surgical equipment were added to the product basket.

The press release added that, in 2022-23, the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Bureau of India registered sales of ₹1,235.95 crore, which led to savings of approximately ₹7,416 crore to citizens. In the current financial year (2023-24), up to November 30, 2023, the bureau had notched up sales of ₹935.25 crore, which led to savings of approximately ₹4,680 crore for citizens. In the past nine years, the press release said, approximately ₹23,000 crore had been thus saved.",thehindu
Passengers miss train at Chennai Central after ticketless people board reserved coaches,"Many passengers could not board a Howrah-bound train after several ticketless or unauthorised people stormed the coaches and occupied reserved berths in Chennai on Tuesday night.

According to passengers who were stranded at the MGR Chennai Central station after they could not board the train, the unauthorised people had barged into the reserved compartments, thereby preventing passengers holding confirmed tickets from entering them.

“We went well in advance and waited for the train. Even as the empty rake was being rolled into the platform, many people got into the coaches. By the time the rake came to a halt, many Sleeper Class coaches were full,” Vinay Yadav of Howrah said.

He said the Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) and other railway staff in the platform could not help in any way. “A couple of our relatives who had to travel due to an exigency boarded the heavily crowded train. We are worried about their safety and well being. Railway authorities should have stopped the train and deployed security personnel to remove unauthorised people and accommodate bonafide passengers,” he said.

Mr. Yadav said he and his family members were stranded at the Chennai Central station as they were left with no place to stay or tickets to travel. “I don’t know whether railways will refund our money. We have been subjected to harassment and mental agony. Many passengers had to miss the train today like us,” he said.

Vignesh of Madurai, whose friends and relatives had come from West Bengal to attend a family wedding, said about 11 passengers, including women, with confirmed tickets could not board the S3 coach of the train.

Unauthorised travellers occupied all the reserved berths and placed their luggage in the walkway. “Dozens of people holding luggage stood near the doors blocking the way for passengers with confirmed tickets to enter. Such incidents are common in North India. Of late, we are seeing this happening in the Southern Railway frequently,” he said.

Railway staff at the station said it was difficult to stop the train and check each and every passenger whether they were having confirmed tickets or not. “Passengers found to be travelling without or waitlisted/unreserved tickets will be removed from the train by the TTE with the help of police,” a railway official said.

With no other option, some passengers decided to find buses to Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam from where they hoped to find more trains to Howrah, the official who did not want to be quoted said.

When contacted, a spokesperson of the Southern Railway said, Railway Protection Force and Government Railway Police personnel were deployed in all platforms to prevent unauthorised persons from occupying reserved coaches. “We have not received any complaint from passengers on the issue so far. Had someone flagged the issue, the RPF personnel would have certainly assisted them in boarding the train,” he said.",thehindu
Geniben Thakor: The giant killer,"For the first time in a decade, the Congress will have a member in the Lok Sabha from Gujarat. In the 2014 and 2019 elections, the BJP swept the home State of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, winning all 26 Lok Sabha seats.

However, in the just concluded national polls, Geniben Thakor, the 49-year-old Congress candidate from Banaskantha in North Gujarat denied a hat-trick sweep to the BJP, by defeating the ruling party’s Rekha Chaudhary.

“Geniben has become a giant killer not just for defeating the BJP candidate but also for smashing the BJP’s giant ego that Gujarat was theirs,” said Gulabsinh Rajput, a former Congress legislator who played a key role in Ms. Thakor’s victory from Banaskantha, a rural district where large number of residents are dependent on dairy farming and animal husbandry. The local Banas Dairy is the largest among over a dozen district milk unions that make up the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation, which markets dairy products under the Amul brand.

It was in Banaskantha, where, during the campaign, Prime Minister Modi said, “If you had two buffaloes, the Congress would take away one if it is voted to power.”

Ms. Thakor comes from a lower middle-class family in Banaskantha. Thakors in Gujarat are spread in the North and Central regions and are called OBC Kshatriya. They are mainly engaged in agriculture with small holdings or are labourers in the farms.

A student of the Jain Vishwa Bharti Institute in neighbouring Rajasthan, Ms. Thakor joined the Congress as a grassroots worker. In 2012, she contested the Assembly elections from Vav constituency but lost.

Five years later, she defeated the BJP’s strongman Shankarbhai Chaudhary, who was a Minister and chairman of the Banas Dairy and Banaskantha District Cooperative Bank. In December 2022, she won again even when the Congress suffered a huge defeat in the State, winning only 17 out of 182.

In the parliamentary polls, the Congress decided to field her from Banaskantha, a seat the party last won in 2009, given her popularity and fighting spirit. Known for her rustic speech and aggressive style and seen as an approachable leader who attends social gatherings frequently, Ms. Thakor caught the fancy of her community.

Notwithstanding her popularity and the community support she enjoyed, the challenge of fighting a Lok Sabha poll was daunting on several counts. First, she hardly had any financial support to take on the BJP’s resources. Second, neither she nor the Congress party had a network of workers and leaders to match the BJP’s well-oiled election machinery.

“It was a fight between Banas Ni Ben (Sister of Banas) vs Banas Bank & Dairy. Everyone in the district knows how the BJP misused the two institutes [the diary and bank cooperatives] to win the polls and yet, the people of Banas have blessed their sister,” Ms. Thakor said.

Though Rekhaben Chaudhary was her rival, for all practical purposes, the election was between Ms. Thakor and local strongman Shankar Chaudhary, who is now the Gujarat Assembly Speaker and the head of the Banas Dairy, which has an annual turnover of over ₹15,000, and vice chairman of the Gujarat State Cooperative Bank. In Gujarat, Chaudharys are a dominant caste spread in the northern districts such as Banaskantha, Mehsana and Sabarkantha and wield considerable clout in local dairies.

To garner financial resources, Ms. Thakor crowdfunded her election, urging the public to contribute to her campaign, which she said would democratise her contest and make it participatory. “Obviously, I had to ask people to support me not only with their votes but also with their monetary contribution because the sky was the limit on the other side with the bank and dairy coffers,” she said, adding that she had urged people to make small contributions like ₹111.

“Her victory is huge considering that she was fighting not only against the BJP but also against the state machinery, bootleggers supported by the police and cooperative institutions,” said Congress leader Jignesh Mevani, who is also a legislator from Banaskantha district.

After Gujarat was separated from Maharashtra and became a State, Ms. Thakor became the second woman to win the Lok Sabha election from the Banaskantha seat. The first was Zohraben Chavda in 1962, the first and only Muslim woman to win Lok Sabha polls in Gujarat.",thehindu
Sarod maestro Pandit Rajeev Taranath passes away,"Sarod maestro Pandit Rajeev Taranath, who was undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Mysuru, passed away on June 11 evening.

A source close to the 92-year-old veteran Indian classical musician said the end came around 6.30 p.m. in the hospital. His mortal remains will kept for public viewing at his residence near Jnana Ganga School in Kuvempunagar in Mysuru from 9 am to 12 noon on June 12.

The distinguished musician leaves behind a son, who is on the way to Mysuru from U.S. The last rites will be performed at the crematorium near Chamundi Foothills at 2 p.m. on June 12, said sources.

Pandit Rajeev Taranath had been hospitalized since the last week of May 2024 for treatment of a fracture. Minister for Social Welfare H C Mahadevappa, who is also the Minister in charge of Mysuru district, visited the sarod exponent at the private hospital and assured that the State Government will bear the expenses of his medical treatment.

A distinguished exponent of Senia Maihar Gharana, Pandit Taranath had been honoured nationally by the Government of India with a Padma Shri in 2019 and the Sangeet Natak Akademi award in 2000. In Karnataka, he has been bestowed with the Rajyothsava award in 1996, Chowdaiah Memorial award in 1998, Sangeet Vidwan award in 2018 and Nadoja award in 2019.

Born on October 17, 1932 to father Pandit Taranath and mother Sumathi Bai, Rajeev Taranath completed his BA Honours from Bangalore Central College by securing the first rank. He added another feather to his academic cap by securing the first rank with a gold medal in M A in English from the University of Mysore in 1962.

He secured a PhD in “Image in Poetry of T S Eliot” under the guidance of Prof C D Narasimhaiah form the University of Mysore.

He began his teaching career as a lecturer at the Hamdard College in Raichur built by his father before teaching at various institutions like Karnatak College in Dharwad, Regional College of Education in Mysuru, Regional College of Engineering and Jamal Mohammed College in Tiruchi, before heading the English Department in Central Institute of English and Foreign Languages in Hyderabad and teaching English in Yemen.

Pandit Rajeev Taranath then gave up his career at REC-T, went to Kolkata (then Calcutta) where he started his musical training under maestro Ali Akbar Khan, beginning a life dedicated to music.

Pandit Rajeev Taranath was also the music director to a number of Kannada movies including Samskara, Pallavi, Anuroopa, Paper Boats and Agunthaka, besides Malayalam movies like Kadavu and Kanchanaseetha.

Condolences have started pouring in for Pandit Rajeev Taranath. Minister in charge of Mysuru district H C Mahadevappa and Minister for Kannada and Culture Shivaraj Tangadagi have condoled the death of the well-known Indian classical music exponent.",thehindu
Why did exit polls go off the mark? | Explained,"The story so far: Ahead of election results on June 4, several exit polls predicted the return of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance to power, with a tally of more than 300 seats for the BJP alone. One pollster, Today’s Chanakya, predicted 400 seats (plus or minus 15) for the NDA, and another, Axis MyIndia, said the NDA would win an average of 381 seats. All these polls were way off the mark, as results showed.

What were the vote share projections?

The CSDS-Lokniti post poll predicted that the NDA would receive a vote share of 46% while that of the INDIA bloc (excluding the Left, Trinamool Congress in West Bengal and AAP in Punjab) would be 35%. The error margin was 3.08% points. The results showed NDA had bagged 292 seats (43.63% vote share) and the INDIA bloc 205 seats (excluding the Trinamool Congress which won 29 seats) with a vote share of 37%. CSDS-Lokniti did not project seats for the alliances but predicted that the NDA would return with a majority. Its vote share figures were within the error margins but were 2.5 points higher for the NDA.

Axis My India projected 47% for the NDA and 39% for the INDIA bloc and the actual results showed that the projections overestimated the NDA vote share beyond the error margins. C-Voter projected a seat tally of 353 to 383 seats for the NDA, with a vote share of 45.3% and 38.9% for the BJP alone, which was 2.3 points higher than the actual vote share for the party -- 36.56%. Its figures for the INDIA bloc were also roughly 2.4 points lower than the actual mark. While the vote shares were within error margins nationally, its seat tallies were way off across several States.

What are exit polls? How are they different from opinion polls?

Opinion polls are sample surveys where a cross section of the electorate is randomly chosen and interviewed about their choice of party or candidates. These polls could either be conducted in-person or over devices as is the case with telephonic surveys. Exit polls ask voters about their choice right after they have exercised their mandate, sometimes outside the polling booth. Some pollsters prefer to do “post-poll surveys” which are conducted at the residence of the voters after they exercise their mandate. CSDS-Lokniti’s poll is a “post-poll survey”. Other surveys such as Axis MyIndia’s were “exit polls”.

Did methodology matter in the way exit polls got the numbers wrong?

For exit polls to be accurate, certain factors have to be kept in mind like the sample size of the survey, the selection process of the sample, the manner in which the survey is conducted, the weighting of the sample according to estimates of the population.

The size of the sample has to be representative and the largeness of the sample is immaterial as long as it is significant enough to statistically predict the winner. If the sample is randomly chosen and the size of the sample is enough to accurately predict the possibility of a certain candidate winning more than 40-45% of the vote — which is generally the case with Indian elections — then even a representative sample of around 20,000-odd respondents is enough to predict winners in a country of a voting population of close to 100 crore. One can conduct larger surveys with more than 20,000 respondents or even with lakhs of respondents but the key to track the mood of the electorate is to get good representation.

CSDS Lokniti’s total sample size was 19,663 across 23 States and 193 parliamentary constituencies while that of Axis MyIndia was 5,82,574 across all the 543 constituencies. But the former got its vote share predictions within the error margins while the latter didn’t.

For good representation, the samples have to be chosen randomly (so as to avoid bias) and also be chosen in a stratified manner (so as to avoid missing out on any section of the population). The most ideal way of choosing a random, but stratified sample, is to use electoral rolls for identifying respondents.

Once sampling is done and the list of respondents are identified, they need to be weighted on the basis of the representation of sections in the population — the percentage of women, Dalits, minorities, majority population, urban vs rural voters. After a representative sample has been prepared, interviews are conducted by surveyors. Ideally, a face-to-face interview works better, and in the same language as the respondent.

As many respondents will not be comfortable in relaying their voting choice to the surveyor, questions should be framed in such a way that the voting choice can be ascertained through this or a mechanism provided in such a way that the respondent records his voter choice without revealing it in the open to the surveyor.

There is a high probability that many respondents, especially those from marginalised sections, either do not reveal their voting preferences or require a measure of trust with the surveyor before opening up on their choices. There is a possibility that the pollsters who got this election wrong either under-sampled marginalised voters or their surveyors were not trusted by the respondents to reveal the right answer or were misled by them.

Once the information is collated, there are other steps to be followed. How do surveyors allocate “undecided” choices? For example, to a question like ‘Who do you vote for?’, there may be answers including ‘Don’t know’ or ‘No opinion’ or ‘No response’ or ‘Won’t tell’? Should surveyors omit them? Or should they weigh them on the basis of the proportion of decided choices? These are important considerations for the surveyor.

What is the process after the surveys are carried out?

Once the survey is done, the results should be matched with the estimated demographic information. If there are 12 respondents among Dalits whose choices are recorded in a population of 100 and the actual proportion of Dalits in that population is 15, then the weighting can be uniformly done for the 15 based on the 12 respondents. But if only 39 women in a population of 100 are interviewed, extrapolating the views of the 39 to that of 48 women (the possible actual estimate of the women population) would be problematic because women do not vote as a single category. This could be one reason why the Axis MyIndia poll got its estimates wrong for many States. The men-women representation in the poll’s sample was 69 to 31.

Most of the pollsters, who had tied up with TV channels, used their surveys to predict seat shares — CSDS Lokniti didn’t. Vote share to seat share conversions can be done in different ways. The most commonly used method is by assessing the swing in vote share for a particular party from previous elections, either in a State or to be more accurate, in a particular region and to be more precise, if the sampling allows the pollster to do so, in a particular constituency. The swing for or against a party as against the same for its opponent(s) can provide the basis for whether an incumbent will be returned from a particular constituency or whether a party can retain a certain number of seats in a region of a State or a State as a whole.

As veteran psephologist and media personality Prannoy Roy points out in his book, The Verdict, written with Dorab R. Sopariwala, some pollsters look at swings from previous polls and the “index of opposition unity” to determine the margin of victory for a particular candidate and predict seat share from vote shares.

There are other methods to evaluate this as well, but conversion of vote shares to seat shares also requires the pollster to be aware of the political dynamics of a particular State, its regions, and what transpired in proximate elections there.

For example, in a State where a particular party wins an Assembly election, it enjoys what is called, a “honeymoon effect” and this has a bearing on the Lok Sabha poll if that election is conducted only a few months after the Assembly polls. In such cases it is better to calculate swings for parties using the Assembly polls in those States as a base rather than the previous Lok Sabha poll.

None of the pollsters who tied up with major television channels got their vote to seat shares right. Since none of them have revealed what they consider their “secret sauce” — the conversion process — it is difficult to ascertain why they got it wrong.

It is evident that pollsters in India mostly get the winner of an election and the seat shares closer to reality when the outcome is decisive. When elections are close, as was the case in this Lok Sabha election, pollsters rarely tend to be accurate on vote and seat shares.

Whether a polling agency has done a good survey is clear from what it reveals in its methodology — the sample size, the mode of survey, the representation of the sample, and the inbuilt error margins. If a survey doesn’t reveal these, it should not be considered serious enough.",thehindu

"Groundwater is heating up, threatening life below and above the surface","Under your feet lies the world’s biggest reservoir. Groundwater makes up a whopping 97% of all usable freshwater. Where is it? In the voids between grains and cracks within rocks. We see it when it rises to the surface in springs, in caves, or when we pump it up for use.

While groundwater is often hidden, it underpins ecosystems around the world and is a vital resource for people.

You might think groundwater would be protected from climate change, given it’s underground. But this is no longer the case. As the atmosphere continues to heat up, more and more heat is penetrating underground. There is already considerable evidence that the subsurface is warming. The heat shows up in temperature measurements taken in boreholes around the world.

Our team of international scientists have combined our knowledge to model how groundwater will heat up in the future. Under a realistic middle of the road greenhouse gas emission scenario, with a projected mean global atmospheric temperature rise of 2.7°C, groundwater will warm by an average of 2.1°C by 2100, compared to 2000.

This warming varies by region and is delayed by decades compared to the surface, because it takes time to heat up the underground mass. Our results can be accessed by everyone globally.

Why does it matter?

You might wonder what the consequences of hotter groundwater will be.

First, the good news. Warming beneath the land’s surface is trapping 25 times less energy than the ocean, but it is still significant. This heat is stored in layers down to tens of metres deep, making it easier to access. We could use this extra heat to sustainably warm our homes by tapping into it just a few meters below the surface.

The heat can be extracted using heat pumps, powered by electricity from renewable energies. Geothermal heat pumps are surging in popularity for space heating across Europe.

Unfortunately, the bad news is likely to far outweigh the good. Warmer groundwater is harmful for the rich array of life found underground – and for the many plants and animals who depend on groundwater for their survival. Any changes in temperature can seriously disrupt the niche they have adapted to.

To date, the highest groundwater temperature increases are in parts of Russia, where surface temperatures have risen by more than 1.5°C since 2000. In Australia, significant variations in groundwater temperatures are expected within the shallowest layers.

Groundwater regularly flows out to feed lakes and rivers around the world, as well as the ocean, supporting a range of groundwater dependent ecosystems.

If warmer groundwater flows into your favourite river or lake, it will add to the extra heat from the sun. This could mean fish and other species will find it too warm to survive. Warm waters also hold less oxygen. Lack of oxygen in rivers and lakes have already become a major cause of mass fish deaths, as we’ve seen recently in Australia’s Murray-Darling Basin.

Cold water species such as Atlantic salmon have adapted to a water temperature window provided by continuous cool groundwater discharge. As these thermal refuges heat up, it will upend their breeding cycle.

In many parts of the world, people rely on groundwater as their main source of drinking water. But groundwater warming can worsen the quality of the water we drink. Temperature influences everything from chemical reactions to microbial activity. Warmer water could, for instance, trigger more harmful reactions, where metals leach out into the water. This is especially concerning in areas where access to clean drinking water is already limited.

Industries such as farming, manufacturing and energy production often rely on groundwater for their operations. If the groundwater they depend on becomes too warm or more contaminated, it can disrupt their activities.

Our study is global, but we have to find out more about how groundwater is warming and what impact this could have locally. By studying how groundwater temperatures are changing over time and across different regions, we can better predict future trends and find strategies to adapt or reduce the effects.

Global groundwater warming is a hidden but very significant consequence of climate change. While the impacts will be delayed, they stretch far and wide. They will affect ecosystems, drinking water supplies and industries around the world.

Actor Darshan and murder case probe: Who is Pavithra Gowda?,"Kannada actor Darshan Thoogudeepa was sent to six-day police custody on June 11, in connection with the murder of one Renukaswamy. The victim was a fan of the actor, and was allegedly tortured and killed for allegedly harassing Pavithra Gowda, a close friend of Mr. Darshan, online.

Who is Pavithra Gowda, the woman caught in this maelstrom and co-accused in the murder case?

In the shadows until last year, Pavithra Gowda came into the spotlight after an Instagram reel of her photos with Darshan went viral on social media. The reel, posted on January 24, 2024, also featured her daughter from a previous marriage. In it, Pavithra indicated celebrating “10 years of relationship” with the ‘Challenging Star.’

The social media post led to Darshan’s wife Vijayalakshmi calling out Pavithra Gowda’s “relationship” with her husband. She uploaded photos of Pavithra with her former husband, and questioned her “agenda” on an Instagram post. The public spat saw a barrage of fury and vitriol being directed towards Pavithra by Darshan fans in all her subsequent social media posts.

Renukaswamy, a resident of Lakshmi Venkateshwara layout in Chitradurga and working in a medical store, had allegedly commented on Pavithra Gowda’s social media account accusing her of creating a rift between his favourite film star and his wife. Renukaswamy allegedly used indecent comments, which miffed Pavithra, who sought the help of the accused to teach him a lesson.

Pavithra’s social media page describes her as a fashion desginer. She is said to be the Managing Director of a boutique in Bengaluru. She entered the film industry aspiring to become an actress, but neither luck nor opportunities favoured her. She acted in four movies, before moving on to becoming an entrepreneur.",thehindu
"CSK vs SRH highlights, IPL 2024 updates: Chennai Super Kings beats Sunrisers Hyderabad by 78 runs","
• None Pathirana for the first time today. Two singles in two balls. A double on the third ball. Asking rate is going up. SRH looking to take it deep. Klaasen and Markram both are important. OUT! Perfect yorker. Middle stump is uprooted and Markram is gone. SRH is five down. Abdul Samad at the crease. Eight runs and a wicket in that over.
• None A fortnight ago, Chennai Super Kings’s campaign was on the right course after beating Mumbai Indians convincingly with four wins out of six. However, defeats in its last two matches have meant the defending champion has been pushed into a corner where it can’t afford further missteps. It is in this situation Ruturaj Gaikwad’s men take on a destructive Sunrisers Hyderabad at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium on Sunday. Though CSK has the best record at home, it will be the team facing the heat. Despite scoring 210 against Lucknow Super Giants in their previous game, the former failed to defend the target, as the medium pacers struggled in dewy conditions. Like CSK, SRH also lost its previous encounter—against Royal Challengers Bengaluru. Though the famed top-order had a rare off-day, the Men in Orange have enough firepower to pose a serious threat against a misfiring CSK bowling attack. After the loss to LSG, CSK coach Stephen Fleming said that the pitch at Chepauk had not played to his side’s strength of spin and wished for a surface that gripped and offered turn. So all eyes will be on the 22-yard strip and whether the home side can get a pitch similar to the one used in the game against Kolkata Knight Riders. A slow track could hold the key to stopping Sunrisers’ belligerent batting line-up, which has posted three totals over 250. The game against RCB showed a potential chink in the armour of the SRH batters when three of the four fell to the slower bowlers, and it is something the hosts will want to exploit.",thehindu

Chandrababu Naidu was sworn in as Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh for the second consecutive term. Governor S. Abdul Nazeer administered the oath of office to Mr. Naidu on June 12 at Kesarapalle close to Gannavaram near Vijayawada. This is the fourth time that Mr. Naidu will be serving as Chief Minister in his more than four decades of political career.

Uttar Pradesh Congress wanted Priyanka Gandhi to contest polls from Varanasi: Ajay Rai,"Uttar Pradesh Congress president Ajay Rai on June 12 said the State unit wanted Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to contest the Lok Sabha polls from Varanasi against Prime Minister Narendra Modi but the party decided that she should campaign across the country.

This comes a day after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said at a rally in Raebareli that had his sister contested the Lok Sabha polls from Varanasi, PM Modi would have lost by two or three lakh votes.

The Congress had fielded Mr. Rai from the Varanasi Parliamentary seat. PM Modi defeated Mr. Rai with a margin of 1,52,513 votes. ""We wanted Priyanka Gandhi to fight against Modi in Varanasi. But the party did not take a call on it because she had to move around the country during the polls,"" Mr. Rai told PTI Videos, in Lucknow.

Mr. Modi's victory margin this year was less than the 2019 and 2014 general elections when he won by 4,79,505 and 3,71,784 votes, respectively. Mr. Rai said the Congress along with its INDIA bloc allies will undertake a 'dhanyavad yatra' to thank the people for supporting the Opposition coalition. He also said that the INDIA bloc parties will fight the 2027 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections together to oust the BJP.

Mr. Rai said the BJP legislators and workers were in a ""feel-good"" mood and thinking that PM Modi is a brand name that will easily win the polls in Varanasi. ""People and INDIA coalition partners made the saffron party sweat in Varanasi,"" he said.

The BJP, which romped to power in 2019 on the back of an unequivocal mandate from Uttar Pradesh, winning 62 of its 80 seats, was cut to size this time and had to be content with only 33.",thehindu

Lt. Gen. Upendra Dwivedi to be next Army chief,"The government on Tuesday announced the appointment of Vice-Chief of Army Staff Lt. Gen. Upendra Dwivedi as the next Army Chief. He will take over from Gen. Manoj Pande on June 30.

“The government has appointed Lt. General Upendra Dwivedi, presently serving as Vice Chief of the Army Staff, as the next Chief of the Army Staff with effect from the afternoon of June 30, 2024. The present Chief of the Army Staff, General Manoj C. Pande, demits office on June 30, 2024,” the Defence Ministry said in a late-evening statement.

Gen. Pande, who was to retire on May 31, had been given a one-month extension. The extension had created speculation in the military fraternity of a possible supersession and deviation from the seniority principle in the appointment of service chiefs.

Born on July 1, 1964, Lt. Gen. Dwivedi was commissioned into the Infantry (Jammu & Kashmir Rifles) of the Army on December 15, 1984. Like Navy Chief Adm Dinesh K. Tripathi, he is also an alumnus of the Sainik School, Rewa.

"Agnipath, modernisation key issues as Rajnath Singh set for second tenure as Defence Minister","As Rajnath Singh takes charge as Defence Minister for a second consecutive term, top issues on the agenda are the Agnipath scheme, pending military modernisation, with focus on indigenisation in addition to situation on the borders, especially with China, where the stand-off in eastern Ladakh still continues. The Agnipath scheme, which was a major issue in the just-concluded elections, will need major changes to address operational contingencies of the armed forces as well as concerns from various allies and political parties.

“Safeguarding India’s border will remain our topmost priority and we shall continue protecting India’s integrity and sovereignty. Under the visionary leadership of PM Modi we shall rededicate ourselves to strengthen ‘Make in India’ and take defence manufacturing and exports to greater heights,” Mr. Singh said on social media ‘X’ on Monday evening after the portfolios were officially announced. A Member of Parliament from Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, he took over as the Defence Minister for the first time on June 1, 2019.

On Tuesday, Sanjay Seth, a second-time MP from Ranchi, Jharkhand, took charge as Minister of State in the Defence Ministry. He was received and briefed about the Ministry by Defence Ministry Secretary Giridhar Aramane.

As reported by The Hindu earlier, as the Agnipath scheme recruitment of soldiers into the three Services completes two years, the Department of Military Affairs (DMA) in the Defence Ministry headed by the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) has sought feedback from the forces on the scheme. There is concern in the Services on the increasing shortage in soldiers due to limited recruitment numbers and the very low conversion to permanent ranks.

Key NDA allies, the Janata Dal (United) and the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), have already raised the issue of Agnipath and called for a detailed discussion on it soon after the election results, and they, as well as other political parties, are expected to take this up once the government is fully in place. “There is anger among voters with regard to the Agnipath scheme. Our party wants that this scheme is discussed threadbare in the government to remove its flaws,” JD(U) national spokesperson K. C. Tyagi said last week, adding that their party’s support to the NDA was “unconditional”.

On June 14, 2022 the government announced the Agnipath scheme for recruitment of soldiers into the armed forces for four years, doing away with the earlier process. The overall intake has been capped at 1.75 lakh till 2026 and Agniveers on completion of four years will get an opportunity to join regular cadre and up to 25% would be selected through another recruitment process.

Major military modernisation has been underway over the last decade but has seen significant delays for a variety of reasons. Several mega deals are lined up, including for a third aircraft carrier, conventional submarines, additional Light Combat Aircraft (LCA)-1A fighters, among others, in addition to speeding up a series of indigenous development programmes in the pipeline, including nuclear attack submarines, jet engines, early warning aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles range of missiles and rockets among other emerging technologies. These are critical to maintain the force levels while also inducting newer technologies in the backdrop of rapid military modernisation in the region, by both China and Pakistan. In this regard, reorienting the ‘Make in India’ initiative to attain desired results and develop a capable domestic military industrial base is a must.

The reorganisation of the military into integrated theatre commands has been on the agenda for several years and this is the top priority for the CDS. After several years and multiple rounds of discussions, broad contours have been agreed upon between the CDS and three Service chiefs, informed sources said, and these would be presented to the government very soon to take the process forward, it has been learnt.",thehindu

"Terrorist, CRPF jawan killed in J&K’s Kathua; 6 security personnel injured in Doda encounter","Five security personnel and an SPO were injured in an exchange of fire between terrorists and security forces in Jammu and Kashmir’s Doda district, following an attack on a joint checkpost, the police said.

The target of the militants apparently was the Indian Army’s Temporary Operating Base. “In Chattergala (Doda), an exchange of fire took place. The Army’s 4 RR and the J&K Police checkpoint came under attack by terrorists. The exchange of fire is on in the area,” ADGP Jain said.

In another terror attack, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawan Kabir Dass was injured in a firing by a terrorist holed up in Kathua district’s Saida Sukhal village around 3 a.m., officials said, adding the soldier was shifted to a hospital where he succumbed to injuries during treatment.

Kabir Dass, who sacrificed his life while fighting terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir’s Kathua region, had rejoined duty only eight days back after completing his leave, his family members in Madhya Pradesh said on Wednesday.

Dass’s mortal remains will be brought to his native village, Pulpul Doh, under Bichhua tehsil in Chhindwara district on Thursday for cremation, family sources told reporters.

“Kabir Dass got married four years ago. He resumed duty only eight days back,” a family member said.

Police and security forces then engaged in an operation to track down the terrorist who hid in the village. After 15 hours, he was killed. The police said with the assistance of the CRPF, they cordoned off the area and conducted house-to-house search.

One family, consisting of a man and his wife, has been evacuated to a hospital. The husband, Omkar Nath, suffered an arm injury and is reported to be in stable condition, while his wife remains unhurt.

The operation in Saida Sukhal began after two recently infiltrated terrorists appeared in the village late Tuesday evening.

According to a police statement, the terrorists asked for water from several houses, raising villagers’ suspicions. When villagers raised an alarm, the terrorists fired randomly, injuring one person.

The Station House Officer (SHO) of Hiranagar and the Sub-Divisional Police Officer (SDPO) engaged the terrorists, resulting in the death of one terrorist who tried to lob a grenade at the police party.

Sharing details about the Kathua operation, Additional Director General of Police, Jammu zone, Anand Jain, said, “Two terrorists who appeared to be freshly infiltrated (from across the border) surfaced in Saida Sukhal village around 8 pm and asked for water from a household. The people got frightened and as soon as information was received, a police team headed by sub-divisional police officer and Station House officer rushed to the village.” According to the ADGP, one terrorist was killed and the operation in the village near Koota Mode in the Hiranagar sector, over 60 km from here, was underway.

The officials said an AK assault rifle and a rucksack were recovered from the possession of the slain terrorist whose identity and group affiliation were being ascertained.

“One of the terrorists tried to hurl a grenade and was killed in the exchange of fire, while the second terrorist is reported to be hiding in the village,” the ADGP added.

These incidents come amid heightened security efforts following an attack on a bus carrying pilgrims from the Shiv Khori temple to Katra in Reasi on Sunday.

The attack, which occurred two days earlier, caused the bus to veer off the road and fall into a deep gorge, leaving nine dead and 41 injured.",thehindu

"U.N. says violence against children in conflict reached extreme levels in 2023, including in Gaza","Violence against children caught in multiplying and escalating conflicts reached “extreme levels” in 2023, with an unprecedented number of killings and injuries in crises, from Israel and the Palestinian territories to Sudan, Myanmar and Ukraine, according to a new U.N. report.

The annual report on Children in Armed Conflict, obtained on June 11 by The Associated Press, reported “a shocking 21% increase in grave violations” against children under the age of 18 in an array of conflicts, also citing Congo, Burkina Faso, Somalia and Syria.

For the first time, the U.N. report put Israeli forces on its blacklist of countries that violate children's rights for the killing and maiming of children and attacking schools and hospitals.

It listed Hamas and Palestinian militants for the first time as well for killing, injuring and abducting children.

Hamas' October 7 surprise attack in southern Israel and Israel's massive military retaliation in Gaza have led to a 155% increase in grave violations against children, especially from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas in Gaza, said the report by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.

The United Nations kept the Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups on its blacklist for a second year over their killing and maiming of children and attacking schools and hospitals in Ukraine.

The U.N. verified the killing of 80 Ukrainian children and maiming of 419 others by Russian forces and their affiliates last year, most from explosive weapons, the report said.

Violations Against Children Amid Escalating Conflicts in Sudan and Myanmar

Sudan, where a war between rival generals vying for power has been raging since 2023, witnessed “a staggering 480% increase in grave violations against children, the report said.

The Sudanese Armed Forces and the rival paramilitary Rapid Support Forces went on the blacklist for killing and injuring youngsters and attacking schools and hospitals — and the paramilitary also for recruiting and using children in military operations and for rape and sexual violence.

By the end of 2023, secretary-general Mr. Guterres said the U.N. had verified 1,721 grave violations against 1,526 children. “I am appalled by the dramatic increase in grave violations,” he said, especially the recruitment, killing and maiming of children as well as sexual violence and attacks on schools and hospitals.

The growing civil war in Myanmar also saw a 123% increase in grave violations against children and the Myanmar armed forces and related militias and seven armed groups are also on this year's blacklist.

The report said the U.N. verified 2,799 grave violations against 2,093 children – including 238 killings and 623 injuries attributed to the military and its allied militias.

Huge jump in violations against children in 2023

The United Nations verified 30,705 violations against children in 2023 and 2,285 committed earlier, affecting over 15,800 boys and more than 6,250 girls. Some were subjected to multiple violations, the report said.

While armed groups were responsible for almost 50 per cent of the grave violations, it said, “government forces were the main perpetrator of the killing and maiming of children, attacks on schools and hospitals, and the denial of humanitarian access.”

Mr. Guterres said the alarming increase in violations is due to “the changing nature, complexity, expansion and intensification of armed conflict, the use of explosive weapons in populated areas, deliberate or indiscriminate attacks against civilians” and infrastructure and other essential buildings, as well as the emergence of new armed groups, acute humanitarian emergencies, and “blatant disregard” for international law.

The U.N. chief said he is “appalled by the dramatic increase and unprecedented scale and intensity of grave violations against children in the Gaza Strip, Israel and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, despite my repeated calls for parties to implement measures to prevent grave violations.”

Mr. Guterres said he was shocked by Hamas and Islamic Jihad's killing, maiming and abduction of children on October 7, 2023, saying nothing can justify these “brutal acts of terror.” And he said he was appalled at reports of sexual violence during the attacks which must be investigated.

The magnitude of the Israeli military campaign against Hamas “and the scope of death and destruction in the Gaza Strip have been unprecedented,” he said, reiterating calls for Israel to abide by international law and ensure civilians are not targeted, and that excessive force is not used during law enforcement operations.

In 2023, the report said, 5,698 grave violations against children were attributed to Israeli forces, 116 to Hamas, 58 to unidentified perpetrators, 51 to Israeli settlers, 21 to Islamic Jihad, 13 to Palestinian individuals, and 1 to Palestinian Authority Security Forces. It said the process of verifying the attribution of 2,051 other violations is ongoing.

Just in the Gaza Strip, the report said the U.N. verified the killing of 2,267 Palestinian children. It said some 9,100 children were reported killed in the territory “and verification is ongoing.”

Overall in the Palestinian territories, it said, “some 19,887 Palestinian children were reported killed or maimed and “the reports are pending verification.”

On a positive note, the secretary-general reported progress in engaging with blacklisted governments and armed groups to protect children. He cited Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Congo, Iraq, Mali, Mozambique, Nigeria, Philippines, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, Ukraine and Yemen.

“More than 10,600 children formerly associated with armed forces or groups received protection or reintegration support during 2023,” Mr. Guterres said.

To get off the blacklist, government forces and armed groups must develop an “action plan” to address the violations with the office of the UN special representative for children in armed conflict, and then implement it.

Mr. Guterres welcomed an offer by the Israeli government on May 28 to engage with special representative Virginia Gamba to develop an action plan.

He also welcomed Russia's continued engagement with Mrs Gamba “to end and prevent grave violations against children,” and urged its armed forces to develop and sign an action plan.",thehindu
No bata to this badi in the heart of Hyderabad,"Telangana Education department’s school enrolment drive Prof. Jayashankar Badi Bata programme is a futile scheme for the Irram Manzil Government High School, Punjagutta.

Established in the 1960s, particularly to admit children of then Secretariat employees when Hyderabad replaced Kurnool as the State capital, the school boasts some prominent alumni: Legislators, bureaucrats, bankers, lawyers and business people.

The school, if seen on a map, had five routes till a year ago. Children would walk the Balapur Basthi road, Irram Manzil colony road, Multiplex Road, through Pukat Nagar and the road opposite supermarket to reach school. Both primary and high school on the same campus had a combined strength of about 600 pupils.

But almost for a year now, the school is left with just one route — circuitously, the entry and exit of the Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS), along the outpatient block, main block, pharmacy, millennium block and the parking area, just like it is for all patients and visitors.

“It’s like telling students to take this route or just don’t come to school. Even getting to the hospital’s main entry and exit is big risk when crossing the roads, and then there is exposure to contagious diseases or hospital-like atmosphere to reach school every day,” says V. Sudhakar of the School alumni association, an active body to protect the school.

Association members firmly say: “We are not against NIMS expansion, but we are against the consistent attempts to erase this school. As agreed earlier, the authorities must build an alternative school accommodation and thereafter touch this.”

Passionate about the school, like the alumni association, are also parents who recently knocked on the doors of the Telangana High Court for immediate intervention.

According to officials who are busy preparing the school for the reopening on June 12, the enrolment this year is 140 for primary school students and about 220 for high school students. There are 10 teachers.

“The other day the contractor started excavating and cut down the old trees on the premises. But soon the alumni members and the locals halted it. Now there is no demolition till a new school is shown,” said the school official requesting anonymity.

While some parents cite “expansion works and long distance to the school” as reasons not to choose Irram Manzil Government High School, for others — the enrolled students, their parents and teachers — continue with the old proverb: ‘Where there is a will, there is a way’.",thehindu
Why India needs a third aircraft carrier,"Recent media reports indicate that the Indian Navy’s long-standing demand for a third aircraft carrier is finally shuffling closer to fruition, with Cochin Shipyard Limited (CSL) set to begin the construction of an add-on Vikrant-class 40,000-odd tonne platform.

Building the Indigenous Aircraft Carrier-2, or IAC-2, albeit with upgrades, modifications and greater local content compared with IAC-1 Vikrant, is also intended to prevent CSL’s carrier-building expertise, from lapsing into disuse. The navy remains palpably conscious of not re-experiencing the ‘lost decade’ between 1995 and 2005 when Mazagaon Dock Shipbuilder’s (MDL) submarine building expertise was allowed to deliberately dissipate.

This costly fumble led to MDL’s submarine construction facilities disintegrating, following the unresolved corruption scandal involving the Indian Navy’s purchase of four German HDW Type 209/1500 diesel-electric submarines (SSKs). These were thereafter resurrected in 2005 at a high cost, to licence-construct six French Scorpene SSKs, five of which have already been commissioned into Indian Navy service, while the sixth is due for induction by the year-end. Hence, the Navy’s keenness on averting such a bloomer with regard to CSL by insisting on a larger carrier of around 65,000 tonne, and settling instead for the ‘interim’ IAC-2.

The IAC-2 would supplement INS Vikramaditya, the 46,000 tonne refurbished Russian Kiev-class vessel and the 40,262 tonne short-take off barrier-arrested recovery (STOBAR) Vikrant, fulfiling the navy’s enduring requirement for one carrier each for its two seaboards, and another in reserve.

The debate over IAC-2 has been plagued by numerous reservations like its astronomical cost of around $5-6 billion and its operational efficacy in an environment of burgeoning anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capability honed by China and Pakistan. The A2/AD is essentially a multi-layered defensive strategy to deter enemy carrier operations.

Furthermore, recent advances in cruise missile technology have made it easier and cheaper for countries like China and Pakistan to conduct A2/AD operations. So much so that even the U.S. Navy considered China’s evolved A2/AD strategy a serious threat to its fleet, and remained wary of challenging it.

OPINION: A warship programme that must go full steam ahead

Moreover, within the Indian Navy, opinion was split between operationally pursuing a ‘sea denial’ strategy, largely by deploying submarines, or alternately seeking a ‘sea control’ approach via costly and relatively more vulnerable carrier battle groups comprising multiple surface and underwater escorts. Some also questioned the monetary logic of building a new carrier at the cost of inducting additional ‘killer-hunters’ SSKs whose numbers in the Indian Navy had depleted to 16, of which 11 from Russia and Germany were either beyond, or nearing retirement. These SSKs were eight boats less than the 24 which the Navy was projected to operate by 2030 in accordance with its Maritime Capability Perspective Plan (MCPP). Correspondingly, equally critical surface combatants like corvettes, nine-sweepers, destroyers and frigates too were in short supply, as were naval utility helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles, and other assorted missiles and ordnance.

Financial constraints have forced the Indian Navy to revise its goal of operating 200 assorted warships by 2027 in keeping with the MCPP. These fiscal shortages had also reduced the Navy’s demand for 12 mine counter-measures to eight and an additional 10 Boeing P-8I Neptune long range maritime multi-mission aircraft, to just six.

Meanwhile, the Indian Air Force (IAF) along with the Indian Army was forever competing for a greater share of depreciating annual defence budgets, as it grappled to make good its fighter, helicopter and transport aircraft shortages, alongside other essential equipment. IAF veterans reasoned that under the prevailing penurious conditions, an aircraft carrier would not only be a ‘costly indulgence’ but more pertinently, entail fielding a platform vulnerable to formidable A2/AD threats.

Other IAF officers believed that SEPECAT Jaguar IM/IS and multi-role Russian Sukhoi Su-30MKI fighters, fitted with enhanced maritime strike capability and extended strike ranges, could project power more economically and securely than a carrier.

The IAF’s maritime Jaguar IM fleet, for instance, is armed with AGM-84L Block II Harpoon missiles and is also being equipped with Israel Aerospace Industries-Elta EL/M-2052/2060 multi-mode active electronically scanned array radar for sea-borne operations.

And, in early 2020 the IAF had commissioned its first Su-30MKI squadron, armed with the BrahMos-A(Air) supersonic cruise missile at Thanjavur on India’s southeast coast to monitor its seacoasts and the wider Indian Ocean Region. Military planners said Su-30MKI would enhance the IAFs capability to engage potential maritime targets with pinpoint accuracy.

Other navalists favoured upgrading the military capabilities of the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago, by creating an A2/AD maritime ‘exclusive zone’ around it to deter, amongst others, the hegemonic Chinese navy. And while the archipelago was undoubtedly ‘immovable’ it was likely to be cheaper than an aircraft carrier, besides being unsinkable.

Continuity and stability: On the Modi government’s new cabinet,"The composition of the new Union Council of Ministers, and the distribution of portfolios, are meant to be seen as an emphatic assertion of authority by Prime Minister Narendra Modi who has won a third term, as leader of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) fell short of an absolute majority in the Lok Sabha by more than 30 seats, but the Council is a signature of continuity from the first two terms. Unlike the previous two terms, partners are crucial for the NDA in the third, but they have political reasons to remain aligned with the BJP. The continuation of all key Ministers in the Cabinet Committee on Security and those in charge of infrastructure portfolios suggests that no dramatic shift in policy should be expected in Mr. Modi’s third term, coalition or not. The TDP, JD(U), JD(S), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar, and the LJP led by Chirag Paswan, have all accepted this reality, bickering by some of them notwithstanding. The composition of the Council is in line with the BJP’s strategy of seeking deeper and wider acceptance among Hindu communities across the length and breadth of the country, and representation for Christians and Sikhs, with the notable exclusion of Muslims.

Rajnath Singh, Amit Shah, Nirmala Sitharaman and S. Jaishankar continue in their previous roles, as Ministers for Defence, Home, Finance and External Affairs, respectively. Mr. Modi evidently trusts them, and their performance, though in the case of Mr. Singh and Mr. Shah, political reasons are also at play. Apart from piloting India’s defence ambitions, Mr. Singh is also expected to use his famed diplomatic skills to deal with politically sensitive issues such as the Agnipath recruitment scheme for the military. Mr. Jaishankar did a commendable job of carefully balancing India’s traditional ties and emerging interests in the previous term. While improving ties with the United States, he has managed to protect the strategic autonomy of India, now with an additional Hindutva hue. Ms. Sitharaman steered the economy through the COVID-19 pandemic turmoil, and has been a champion of its prospects. She has, however, not managed the contentious questions of Centre-State fiscal relations very well. Mr. Shah has a long list of politically sensitive issues to tackle in his new term — completion of the Census operation, transition of the criminal justice system with the implementation of the new criminal codes, and Centre-State relations, among other things. The Ministers have their task cut out, and stability helps. They will also be called upon to exercise wisdom.",thehindu
"Facts in fiction: on stopping the release of the Hindi film, Hamare Baarah","The likelihood of protests, communal tension or prejudice to law and order ought not to be cited as a reason to suspend the screening of a film. The Karnataka government’s decision to stop the release of the Hindi film, Hamare Baarah, for two weeks violates the freedom of expression in the name of upholding order and preventing communal tension. Such a ban on public screening of films, independent of their merit, has no place in a democratic society. The Bombay High Court, which initially stayed the release of Hamare Baarah, has lifted the ban, following the producer’s offer to remove some controversial dialogues. Its observation that allowing an individual to stall the release of a certified film would encourage film producers being held to ransom is consistent with judicial precedents. Once it is certified by the Central Board of Film Certification, presumably after proper scrutiny of its suitability for public viewing, there ought to be no scope for a second opinion by a law enforcement authority. The position that a work, be it a book or a play or a film, may be proscribed under threat of protests or likely violence has been rebuffed by the Supreme Court of India in some landmark verdicts. “... freedom of expression cannot be suppressed on account of threat of demonstration and processions or threats of violence,” the Court said in its 1989 judgment in S. Rangarajan vs P. Jagjivan Ram on the film, Ore Oru Gramathile.

The emphasis on freedom of expression does not mean that one should endorse any film whose content is distasteful or obnoxious or contains vile propaganda. As for the film now under the scanner, there is reason to believe that such criticism is justified, beginning with the overt communal overtones in its title itself. Its posters and synopsis suggest that the film draws upon sectarian allegations that the Muslim community is responsible for population growth and that its men force women to bear many children, in utter disregard of their health and well-being. The film’s proponents may claim it is about spreading awareness on population control, and that watching the film may dispel such an impression. However, it cannot be denied that contemporary film-making has made stereotyping the Muslim community a significant trend. Any film that gives prominence to the claim that members of the community have more children, must be aimed at pandering to communal sections and the political establishment that encourages them. If the country is to be a free and open society, there is no need to suppress any point of view. At the same time, it must also develop the wherewithal to counter sectarian propaganda with facts and without resort to unconstitutional methods.",thehindu
"In dilemma on whether to retain Wayanad or Rae Bareli Lok Sabha seat, says Rahul Gandhi","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi who won from Wayand and Rae Bareli Lok Sabha seats in the 2024 General Elections said on June 12 that he was in a dilemma as to which constituency he should relinquish.

Mr. Gandhi, however, said that whatever decision he takes, both the constituencies will be happy with it.

He thanked the people of Wayanad for electing him for a second term in Lok Sabha and said, “I look forward to seeing you soon.” “I have a dilemma before me, whether I should be the MP of Wayanad or of Rae Bareli. What I will commit to you is that both Wayand and Rae Bareli will be happy with my decision,” the Congress leader said while speaking at a public meeting in Malappuram.

It is his first appearance in the State after winning the Wayanad LS seat by a huge margin for the second consecutive time.

Mr. Gandhi took a dig at Narendra Modi by saying that he does not receive any directions from God on what has to be done the way the PM does.

Mocking at Mr. Modi, the Congress leader said God directs the PM to hand over the country’s major airports and power plants to Adani.

“But, I am a human being. My God are the poor people of the country. So, for me it is easy. I just talk to the people and they tell me what to do,” Mr. Gandhi said.

During his speech, he also said that the fight in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls was for protecting the Constitution of India and in that fight, hatred has been defeated by love and affection, arrogance by humility.

Mr. Gandhi also said that PM Modi will now have to change his attitude because the people of India have sent him a clear message.

The Congress leader called the government formed at the Centre as a “crippled one”.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Gandhi, who won the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat by huge margin for a second consecutive time, held a roadshow in Malappuram district in north Kerala.

This is Mr. Gandhi's first visit to Kerala after the 2024 Lok Sabha election results.

Thousands of United Democratic Front (UDF) workers and supporters gathered along the route of the roadshow at Edavanna, which is part of the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat.

Mr. Gandhi was also given a rousing welcome at the Kozhikode airport by party leaders and workers.",thehindu
